Luke Skywalker,172,77,blond,fair,blue,19BBY,male,Tatooine,Human,"Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo, Skywalker served on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic—an organization committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.
The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by killing Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.
With the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker traveled across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. One of his apprentices was his sister's son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline's raw strength and potential for limitless power. The loss of his nephew, who fell to the dark side like Vader before him, haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. In addition, the destruction of his nascent Order convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world of Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the rise of the First Order. His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.
In 35 ABY, Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the war. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, Skywalker urged Rey to confront her grandfather, the resurrected Darth Sidious. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister were watching over Rey when she took their family name as her own."
C-3PO,167,75,NA,gold,yellow,112BBY,NA,Tatooine,Droid,"C-3PO, sometimes spelled See-Threepio and often referred to simply as Threepio, was a 3PO-series protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. He was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.
C-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, a human slave who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years. At some point during this time, 3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.
They became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. After meeting Skywalker's son, Luke and the smuggler Han Solo, the droids helped rescue princess Leia from the Empire's Death Star. They became directly attached to the three humans, helping them and their rebellion defeat the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy, most notably when he convinced the Ewoks to aid the Rebels at the Battle of Endor.
Following the Battle of Endor, C-3PO continued serving the Skywalkers and Han Solo during the time of the New Republic. About thirty years after the events on Endor, C-3PO was still an aide to Leia Organa, who had become a General in the Resistance, a private military group opposed to the First Order, a military junta that emulated the Old Empire. By that time, C-3PO's language database had been updated so that he could understand and communicate in over seven million different forms of communication, including ancient Sith dialects."
R2-D2,96,32,NA,"white, blue",red,33BBY,NA,Naboo,Droid,"R2-D2, pronounced Artoo-Deetoo and often referred to as R2 (Artoo), was an R2-series astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton with masculine programming. A smart, spunky droid who would serve a multitude of masters over his lifetime, R2-D2 was never given a full memory wipe (apart from a partial wipe of select information by Cad Bane during the senate hostage crisis) nor did he ever receive new programming, with these factors resulting in an adventurous and independent attitude. Often finding himself in pivotal moments in galactic history, his bravery and ingenuity saved the galaxy on numerous occasions.
Beginning his service in the employ of Queen Amidala of Naboo, R2-D2 wound up serving Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, often accompanied by the protocol droid C-3PO in many adventures throughout the Clone Wars. After Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, the droid served Senator Bail Organa for a time in the Imperial Senate. Nineteen years following the purge of the Galactic Republic, R2-D2 played a pivotal role in helping the Rebel Alliance destroy the Empire's Death Star superweapon. He carried technical readouts vital to its destruction. Serving Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the son of his two former masters throughout the Galactic Civil War, he participated in both the Battles of Hoth and Endor, and witnessed the successful destruction of the Empire's second Death Star four years after the first one was demolished.
In the subsequent thirty years, R2 accompanied Luke Skywalker until the undoing of his attempted resurrection of the Jedi Order in 28 ABY. Following Luke's disappearance, R2 entered a self-imposed low power mode as newer droid models started to out-compute the aging astromech. Despite this, his celebrated role in the Rebellion protected him from the usual recycling procedure of many old droids, allowing him a semi-retirement in the Resistance as he pored over several decades of uninterrupted data, and ""dreamed"" of his greatest adventures."
Darth Vader,202,136,none,white,yellow,41.9BBY,male,Tatooine,Human,"Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive Human male who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight and later served the Galactic Empire as the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Born to the slave Shmi Skywalker in 41.9 BBY, Anakin was conceived by midi-chlorians, the symbiotic organisms that allowed individuals to touch the Force, and he and his mother were brought to the desert planet of Tatooine to be the slaves of Gardulla the Hutt. They soon ended up as the property of the Toydarian Watto, and Skywalker exhibited exceptional piloting skills and a reputation for being able to build and repair anything even at a young age. In 32 BBY, Skywalker encountered the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Padmé Amidala, and he helped them secure the parts they needed for their starship by winning the Boonta Eve Classic podracing event—only to learn that he had also won his freedom in doing so.

Reluctantly leaving his mother behind, Skywalker accompanied Jinn and his group to the Republic's capital of Coruscant and participated in the Battle of Naboo, helping to free Amidala's homeworld from the armies of the Trade Federation. While Jinn was killed during the battle, Jinn's student Obi-Wan Kenobi followed Jinn's wishes and took on Skywalker as his Padawan, and much of the Jedi Council believed that Skywalker was the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy: one who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith Order. Skywalker and Kenobi had a number of adventures during the Padawan's decade of training to become a Jedi, but as the Separatist Crisis threatened to tear the Republic apart in 22 BBY, Skywalker was reunited with Amidala when he was assigned to protect her from assassins. The two grew close during the course of the assignment, though they were caught up in the Battle of Geonosis and the beginning of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Losing an arm during the fighting, Skywalker received a cybernetic replacement, and he and Amidala were secretly married in the days after the battle, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions on romantic attachments.

During the Clone Wars, which raged for the next three years, Skywalker was granted the rank of Jedi Knight and became known to the public as the ""Hero with No Fear."" Taking on the Togruta Ahsoka Tano as his apprentice, Skywalker fought alongside Kenobi and his fellow Jedi in scores of battles, and his friendship with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine deepened despite the Jedi Order's wariness of Palpatine's rapid acquisition of further powers during the course of the war. Throughout the Clone Wars, Skywalker's anger and sense of loss pushed him ever closer to the dark side of the Force, and his visions of Amidala dying in childbirth in 19 BBY made him desperate to find a way to save his wife. Palpatine, who was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, manipulated Skywalker into becoming his apprentice with the promise of saving Amidala, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader as Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and eradicated the Jedi Order.

Vader and Kenobi clashed on Mustafar after Vader attacked his wife in the belief that she had betrayed him, and the newly christened Sith Lord was left limbless and ravaged by fire at the end of their battle. Encased in a suit of life-sustaining black armor and believing his wife to be dead, Vader embraced his role as the Emperor's right hand and enforcer, hunting down Jedi survivors and enforcing the will of the Empire for years to come. The Sith Lord trained a number of secret apprentices and Dark Jedi, though his plans to overthrow his master had not advanced far when the Galactic Civil War erupted between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 2 BBY. In 0 BBY, the Death Star—the Empire's greatest superweapon—was destroyed by a young Rebel pilot despite Vader's efforts, and Vader became obsessed with discovering the pilot's identity, only to learn that it was Luke Skywalker: his own son, born before Amidala's death.

Vader continued to pursue both Skywalker and the Alliance over the next three years, finally luring his son into a trap on the mining colony of Cloud City in 3 ABY where the two dueled. Vader revealed his identity to Skywalker, though his son refused to join him and escaped. When Darth Sidious learned of Skywalker's existence, he set in motion his own plans to recruit Skywalker and thereby replace Vader, but Skywalker surrendered himself to Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor in 4 ABY in hopes of redeeming his father and turning him back to the light side. In a final duel on the second Death Star as the Battle of Endor raged around them, Skywalker and Vader fought each other, and Vader refused his son's attempts to redeem him, learning that Skywalker had a twin sister named Leia in the process. Skywalker defeated his father but refused to kill him, and when Sidious attempted to kill the young man, Vader—moved by his son's love—abandoned the dark side and sacrificed himself to destroy the Emperor, fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Mortally wounded, Anakin made peace with his son and became one with the Force, though his reputation, his legacy, and his family endured for decades afterwards."
Leia Organa,150,49,brown,light,brown,19BBY,female,Alderaan,Human,"Leia Skywalker Organa Solo was a Force-sensitive human female political and military leader who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Imperial Era and the New Republic and Resistance in the subsequent New Republic Era. Adopted into the House of Organa, the Alderaanian royal family, she was Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, a planet in the Core Worlds known for its dedication to pacifism. The princess was raised as the daughter of Senator Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, making her the heir to the Alderaanian monarchy. Instilled with the values of her adopted homeworld, Organa devoted her life to the restoration of democracy by opposing authoritarian regimes such as the Galactic Empire and the First Order.
Born in 19 BBY as Leia Amidala Skywalker, she was the biological offspring of the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. Her birth occurred in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, which saw the Jedi Order purged and the Galactic Republic reorganized into the Galactic Empire. With her mother's death in childbirth and her father's fall to the dark side of the Force, Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker were separated to keep them hidden from the Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. As the adopted daughter of a politician, Leia Organa eventually succeeded Bail by representing their homeworld in the Imperial Senate, though secretly she supported the Rebellion. During the Galactic Civil War, however, Alderaan was destroyed along with its inhabitants and the royal family by the Empire's DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station, causing Organa to openly fight the New Order as a leader of the Rebel Alliance.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Organa married the Corellian smuggler Han Solo and learned the Jedi arts as her brother's apprentice until giving birth to her son, Ben Solo, on the day of the Empire's capitulation in 5 ABY. Her personal and political life suffered in the years that followed, with Ben turning to the dark side like his grandfather before him, adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, and the Galactic Senate sidelining Organa's career. Adopting the military rank of general, she led the Resistance during the Cold War and sought to make amends with Ben. Despite her efforts, the First Order succeeded in destroying the New Republic, and Organa's husband died at the hand of their estranged son in 34 ABY. Organa continued to lead the Resistance during the war against the First Order, all the while training Rey—a Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakku—as a Jedi.
As her health declined, Organa used her remaining strength to reach her son, calling him back to the light side of the Force. Following her death on Ajan Kloss in 35 ABY, the Resistance defeated the forces of the reborn Darth Sidious's Sith Eternal on Exegol, and inspired an uprising against the First Order across the galaxy. The heir to three inheritances, Leia Skywalker Organa Solo's legacy passed on to the Jedi Rey Skywalker, the military leader Poe Dameron of the Resistance, and Ben Solo, her only son, who ultimately returned to the light and sacrificed himself for Rey."
Owen Lars,178,120,"brown, grey",light,blue,52BBY,male,Tatooine,Human,"Owen Lars was a human male moisture farmer from the desert planet Tatooine. He was the son of Aika and Cliegg Lars, and he became the stepbrother of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker when Cliegg married Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker. In 22 BBY, Shmi was killed by Tusken Raiders, and Cliegg passed away soon after. Lars married his girlfriend, Beru Whitesun, and they toiled to maintain the homestead.
In 19 BBY, Lars and his wife were contacted by Skywalker's Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and they were tasked with caring for Skywalker's infant son, Luke. Lars believed that Skywalker had died due to his role as a Jedi, so to protect Luke, the farmer forbade Kenobi from visiting or training the boy. In the following years, Lars prevented Luke from knowing the truth about his father, and he kept the boy busy with farm work.
In 0 BBY, Lars and Luke Skywalker purchased the droid R2-D2, who, unbeknownst to them, possessed stolen plans for the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon. Imperial stormtroopers tracked the droid to Lars' homestead, where they interrogated and murdered both him and his wife. When Skywalker discovered that his family had been killed, he left Tatooine with Kenobi to train as a Jedi, joining the Rebel Alliance and destroying the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin."
Beru Whitesun lars,165,75,brown,light,blue,47BBY,female,Tatooine,Human,"Beru Whitesun Lars, born Beru Whitesun, was a human female from the planet Tatooine. She was married to Owen Lars, the stepbrother of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whose son, Luke Skywalker, they raised during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Lars was killed along with her husband by Imperial stormtroopers, who also burned down the Lars moisture farm. With their deaths, Skywalker left his homeworld and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic."
R5-D4,97,32,NA,"white, red",red,NA,NA,Tatooine,Droid,"R5-D4, also called ""Red"" by Luke Skywalker, was a red and white-striped R5 astromech droid owned by a group of Jawas on Tatooine in the early days of the Galactic Civil War. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Jawas attempted to sell him to Owen Lars, but the droid purposely malfunctioned his motivator at the advice of R2-D2, so that Lars could purchase R2-D2 in R5-D4's place. The droid survived an Imperial attack on the sandcrawler soon after, and went out to find the rebellion. R5 was still active by the time of the New Republic Era, and eventually came into the service of Peli Motto. He projected a map of Tatooine in order to assist the Mandalorian Din Djarin."
Biggs Darklighter,183,84,black,light,brown,24BBY,male,Tatooine,Human,"Biggs Darklighter was a human male ace pilot who fought for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early days of the Galactic Civil War. He grew up on the desert world of Tatooine, where he became a close boyhood friend of Luke Skywalker. The two became pilots and dreamed of leaving Tatooine. Darklighter left his homeworld for the Imperial Academy, but defected from the Galactic Empire after graduation in order to join the Rebel Alliance. He returned to Tatooine one final time to tell Skywalker of his plans.
With his home planet behind him, Darklighter relocated to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. He reunited with Skywalker, who had helped rescue Princess Leia Organa, a leader in the Alliance, from the Death Star with stolen plans for the planet-destroying space station. The Rebellion analyzed the plans and organized the Battle of Yavin, where Darklighter and Skywalker flew as members of Red Squadron in the assault on the station. Skywalker successfully destroyed the Death Star, but not before Darklighter was killed in combat by Darth Vader."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,182,77,"auburn, white",fair,blue-gray,57BBY,male,Stewjon,Human,"Obi-Wan Kenobi was a legendary human male Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Republic Era. During the Imperial Era, he adopted the alias Ben Kenobi in order to hide from the regime that drove the Jedi to near extinction. A noble man known for his skills with the Force, Kenobi trained Anakin Skywalker, served as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, and became a mentor to Luke Skywalker prior to his death in 0 BBY.
Born on the planet Stewjon in 57 BBY, Kenobi joined the Jedi Order—an order of Force-sensitive peacekeepers—at a young age. Following his initial lessons under Grand Master Yoda, he became the Padawan of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Kenobi defeated the Sith Lord Darth Maul and was awarded the status of Jedi Knight. As a result of Jinn's death, Kenobi took on the task of training Anakin Skywalker, but often had to rein in his adventure-seeking apprentice. Although he deemed Skywalker arrogant and overconfident in his Force powers, Kenobi also regarded him as a brother and good friend. Moreover, he was convinced that Skywalker was the Chosen One destined to bring the Force into balance by destroying the Sith.
In the aftermath of the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, Kenobi and his fellow Jedi defended the Galactic Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, becoming generals in the Republic Military. As the commanding officer of the 7th Sky Corps, Kenobi's second-in-command was Clone Marshal Commander CC-2224 ""Cody,"" although he also often served with Skywalker who commanded the elite 501st Legion. In 19 BBY, Kenobi destroyed General Grievous, effectively ending the Clone Wars. By then, however, Order 66 was activated by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, which resulted in the clone troopers turning against their Jedi officers. Kenobi survived Cody's betrayal, only to discover that Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force as Darth Vader. A fateful battle ensued between the former friends, and ended with Kenobi leaving Vader to die on Mustafar. With the Jedi all but extinct, Kenobi exiled himself to Tatooine where he lived as a hermit for two decades.
During the Galactic Civil War, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan was captured by the Galactic Empire while attempting to recruit Kenobi for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Kenobi chose to answer the Alliance's plea for help, and also began training Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, who sought to become a Jedi like his father before him. Their time together was cut short, however, as Kenobi sacrificed himself to protect Skywalker. Vader struck down his former master, but ultimately death was not the end for Kenobi, having preserved his consciousness as a Force spirit. He would continue to watch over Skywalker, guiding him on his path to knighthood."
Anakin Skywalker,188,84,blond,fair,blue,41.9BBY,male,Tatooine,Human,"Anakin Skywalker was a human male Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic and the Chosen One of the Force. During the Clone Wars, his accomplishments as a Jedi General earned him the Hero With No Fear moniker. After turning to the dark side of the Force, he became known as Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith and Sith apprentice to Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. As a Sith Lord, Vader turned against his former comrades and hunted the surviving Jedi into near extinction. He became an enforcer of the Galactic Empire, and worked to crush the Alliance to Restore the Republic for opposing his Sith Master's will. Yet despite his actions as Darth Vader, a glimmer of the light side of the Force remained within the former Anakin Skywalker.
Skywalker was born in the year 41 BBY on the Outer Rim planet Tatooine during the Age of the Republic. Although he had a mother, the slave Shmi Skywalker, the truth about his parentage was that Anakin had no father—leading Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to suspect that Skywalker's conception was the work of the midi-chlorians. Recognizing the child's unprecedented connection to the Force, Jinn was determined to see Skywalker trained as a member of the Jedi Order, the task of which ultimately fell to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi following Jinn's death by Darth Maul in 32 BBY.
Over the next decade, Skywalker rose to become one of the strongest Jedi in galactic history. While he was both caring and compassionate, his fear of loss was ultimately the catalyst for his downfall. During the Clone Wars, Skywalker trained a Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, who ultimately left the Jedi Order after she was framed for the terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple. The loss of Tano affected Skywalker on a personal level, causing him to feel more isolated and bitter towards the Jedi High Council. With the Clone Wars nearing conclusion, Skywalker succumbed to the temptations of the dark side, believing the Sith had the power to save the life of Senator Padmé Amidala, his secret wife. Christened ""Darth Vader"" by his new Master Darth Sidious, the newly minted Sith Lord assaulted the Coruscant Jedi Temple, killing fully trained Jedi and novice younglings alike.
After assassinating the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Vader was confronted on Mustafar by his former friend and mentor, Kenobi, resulting in a lightsaber duel that left Vader badly burned and mutilated. As a consequence of his defeat, he was rebuilt as a cyborg and encased in a life-sustaining suit of armor, further distancing the persona of Vader from that of Skywalker. In addition, Amidala's death in childbirth broke the fallen Jedi Knight's heart, leaving him more machine than man mentally as well as physically.
Throughout the Dark Times, the former Anakin Skywalker brought fear to the galaxy in his capacity as the Emperor's dark enforcer. However, in spite of his deep immersion in darkness, Vader never succeeded in fully killing the side of himself that was Skywalker. His confrontation with his son, the aspiring Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, during the Galactic Civil War awoke the compassion within the Sith Lord, causing Vader to renounce his allegiance to the Sith in order to save Luke from the Emperor's wrath. By killing his master, however, Vader sustained critical damage to his armor, making death inevitable. Resigned to his fate, his dying wish was to see his son with his own eyes for the first and final time. In the end, he died not as Darth Vader but as Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One who brought balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. His destiny fulfilled, Skywalker's consciousness was able to endure beyond death due to his sacrifice and redemption, allowing him to live on in spirit alongside his deceased Jedi mentors, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda.
Decades after the Battle of Endor, Anakin's footsteps were followed in by Ben Solo, his grandson by Princess Leia Organa, Skywalker's daughter, and the smuggler Han Solo. Ben fell to the dark side and took the identity of Kylo Ren under the influence of Supreme Leader Snoke, believing it was his destiny to complete Vader's legacy and annihilate the Jedi Order. However, Ren was ultimately redeemed. Becoming Ben Solo again, he sacrificed himself to save Rey after she died destroying the resurrected Darth Sidious with the help of the spirits of the past Jedi, including Anakin. Thus, the Sith's rebirth was prevented and balance was preserved."
Wilhuff Tarkin,180,NA,"auburn, grey",fair,blue,64BBY,male,Eriadu,Human,"Wilhuff Tarkin was a human male politician, bureaucrat, and military officer whose career spanned the Fall of the Republic and the Age of the Empire. Born on the planet Eriadu in 64 BBY, he was a member of the Tarkin family and the great-nephew of Jova Tarkin. During the Republic Era, Tarkin served in the Galactic Republic's Judicial Department for a time before returning to his homeworld as the Governor of Eriadu. When the Clone Wars began, he renewed his military service, becoming a commissioned officer in the Republic Navy.
As a captain, Tarkin served under Jedi General Even Piell until the latter's death on Lola Sayu, where the two were held as prisoners in the Citadel by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Saved by a Jedi-led rescue team, Tarkin grew to respect the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who agreed with the captain's belief that the Jedi Code conflicted with their wartime duties. He staunchly opposed the Jedi Order's role as leaders in the Grand Army of the Republic, believing that peacekeepers should not direct the Republic war effort. A favorite of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, Tarkin served on the Strategic Advisory Cell and was promoted to the military rank of Admiral. When Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, it was Tarkin who acted as the prosecutor in her trial.
Tarkin continued to rise in power with the proclamation of a new regime, the Galactic Empire, ruled by the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine. Joining the ranks of the New Order's regional governors, Grand Moff Tarkin administrated the Outer Rim Territories and was also involved in the secret construction of the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station. As governor of the regions of space along the galactic frontier, he sought to enforce Imperial rule on restive worlds such as Lothal where rebel cells grew increasingly bold in their opposition to the Empire. Having retained Palpatine's favor in the New Order, Tarkin often worked alongside the Emperor's chief enforcer, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he once knew as Skywalker.
A proponent of the doctrine of fear, he believed that the battle station and its planet-killing superweapon would terrify the galaxy into total submission. At Tarkin's command the Core World Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star, instantly killing billions of Alderaanians. Tarkin ultimately perished, however, when the Alliance to Restore the Republic succeeded in destroying the station at the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. As a result, his memory was tarnished in the views of some Imperial officers, such as Grand General Cassio Tagge, who referred to the Death Star as ""Tarkin's folly."" Princess Leia Organa remembered Tarkin as the man who destroyed her adopted homeworld and family long after his death. The First Order, having risen to power as the Empire's successor opposing the New Republic, commemorated Tarkin's memory in an effort to portray Imperial leaders in a more heroic light."
Chewbacca,228,112,brown,NA,blue,200BBY,male,Kashyyyk,Wookiee,"Chewbacca, known affectionately to his friends as Chewie, was a Wookiee male warrior, smuggler, mechanic, pilot, and resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the conflict and subsequent war between the First Order and the Resistance. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi Master Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee Tarfful, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.
In the years that followed, during the rule of the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca was enslaved by the Empire until he was rescued by Captain Han Solo and became his co-pilot aboard the Millennium Falcon. Together, they assisted Tobias Beckett and Qi'ra in a coaxium run for Crimson Dawn. They later worked in the employ of crime lord Jabba the Hutt until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to ferry him, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to Alderaan on a mission vital to the survival of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After finding Alderaan was destroyed, the group was brought aboard the Death Star, where they helped Princess Leia Organa escape from captivity and return to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the Battle of Yavin and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.
Throughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an assault on Cymoon 1 and the battle on Vrogas Vas. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from Echo Base on the planet Hoth after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with Lando Calrissian, an old friend of Solo's, on Cloud City, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to Darth Vader, the Emperor's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was frozen in carbonite and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, where Chewbacca and his friends saved Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the Battle of Endor, where Chewbacca helped destroy the shield generator and allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. The Emperor was killed for the first time aboard the battle station, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.
After Endor and the rise of the New Republic, Chewbacca and Solo fought to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his family. After Solo's son Ben, turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the Millennium Falcon and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the Eravana, but they eventually found the Falcon and, with it, stowaways named Rey, Finn, and the droid BB-8. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the assault to destroy Starkiller Base, a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet Ahch-To on the Falcon, where they found Luke Skywalker. After Solo's death, Chewbacca often served as the sole pilot of the Falcon, including piloting the ship to aid the Resistance during the Battle of Crait.
Roughly a year after the battle of Crait, Chewbacca was one of the last of the Resistance. Having learned of the mysterious return of the Emperor, Chewbacca and the crew of the Falcon, now including Poe Dameron, traveled to the planets Pasaana and Kijimi to find a clue to how to find where the Emperor was hiding, being reunited with his friend Calrissian in the process. The quest nearly ended in Chewie's death, as Rey, having been revealed to be the Emperor's granddaughter through his son, lashed out with dark power during a fight with Kylo Ren and destroyed a First Order transport that she had thought Chewie had been loaded onto, seemingly killing him.
However, Chewie survived and was rescued by the Resistance as they continued the quest. Rey eventually found Exegol during a failed self-exile attempt to protect the galaxy from her becoming a Sith, and led the charge during the battle that ensued later on. Rey ultimately killed her malevolent grandfather with the help of the returned Ben Solo in the climax of the battle, while the Resistance, joined by the citizens' fleet, progressively overpowered the Sith fleet that the Emperor planned to unleash.
Having destroyed the Sith once and for all, the Resistance reveled in their victory, but also mourned their losses, including Leia, who had died of natural causes shortly after reaching out to her son and helping him turn back towards the light."
Han Solo,180,80,brown,fair,brown,29BBY,male,Corellia,Human,"Han Solo, known only as Han until being given the surname Solo by an Imperial recruitment officer, and formerly known as Cadet 124-329 while serving as an Imperial cadet, was a human male smuggler. He became a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. He hailed from Corellia and became a smuggler, even completing the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon, and coming under the employ of Jabba the Hutt. He was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, husband of Princess Leia Organa, brother-in-law of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted copilot who swore a life debt to the Corellian smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of money as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan, but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Leia Organa escape from the Death Star, briefly fought in the Battle of Yavin, which allowed Skywalker to destroy the superweapon. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of years afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.
After the Battle of Hoth, Solo sought refuge with Organa—with whom he had fallen in love—Chewbacca, and C-3PO on Cloud City, which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the city. Solo was frozen in carbonite and taken to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, where he remained encased in carbonite for months until he was rescued by his friends. After returning to the Alliance Fleet, Solo was promoted to the rank of general and was given command of the Pathfinders, a special forces squad, for the Battle of Endor. Solo led the Pathfinders to Endor, where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native Ewoks, destroyed the shield generator protecting the second Death Star that was being constructed in orbit. Their actions allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the superweapon.
The Battle of Endor, which saw the deaths of Emperor Sheev Palpatine and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the New Republic. In the early days after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He married Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the dark side of the Force—like his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was Force-sensitive—so Organa sent him to be trained as a Jedi by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by Snoke, Supreme Leader of the First Order, resulting in the destruction of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order.
Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the Millennium Falcon to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a scavenger named Rey and a defected First Order stormtrooper named Finn, who carried with them a droid, BB-8, that had part of a map to Skywalker's location. Solo, who retrieved the Falcon from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the Resistance against the First Order, and fought in the battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with his lightsaber. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon. However, Solo's memory remained alive and appeared in a Force vision a year later to convince Ren to abandon the dark side and defeat the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, after a duel on the remains of the second Death Star between Rey and Ren, being enough for Ben Solo to return and eventually sacrifice his own life to rescue Rey."
Greedo,173,74,NA,green,black,44BBY,male,Rodia,Rodian,"Greedo was a male Rodian bounty hunter who grew up on Tatooine in Mos Espa. During the Clone Wars, he was hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Chi Eekway Papanoida and Che Amanwe Papanoida, the daughters of Chairman Papanoida, but was forced by the chairman to lead him and his son Ion to them. He was occasionally hired by crime lord Jabba the Hutt for various mercenary jobs, including the capture of Han Solo, who killed the luckless Rodian."
Jabba Desilijic Tiure,175,"1,358",NA,"green-tan, brown",orange,600BBY,hermaphrodite,Nal Hutta,Hutt,"Jabba Desilijic Tiure, more commonly referred to as Jabba the Hutt or simply Jabba, and formally styled as His Excellency Jabba Desilijic Tiure of Nal Hutta, Eminence of Tatooine, was a Hutt gangster and crime lord, as well as a member of the Grand Hutt Council, who operated and led a criminal empire from his palace on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Jabba was a major figure on Tatooine, where he controlled the bulk of the trafficking in illegal goods, piracy and slavery that generated most of the planet's wealth. He was also highly influential in the entire Outer Rim as one of its most powerful crime lords.
During the Clone Wars, Jabba's influence and power over the Outer Rim, specifically its hyperlanes, was sought by both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who both courted Jabba's approval. When Rotta, Jabba's son, was kidnapped, the crime lord promised his support to whoever returned his son. When the Separatists were revealed to have orchestrated Rotta's kidnapping, Jabba pledged his support to the Republic.
Jabba continued to operate in the Outer Rim after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, preserving his power base, despite the interference of Darth Sidious, the Galactic Emperor. After the destruction of the Death Star by the Rebel Alliance, the Emperor sent Darth Vader to negotiate a deal with Jabba to secure raw materials for Imperial military production. Jabba's alliance with the Empire allowed him and the Hutts to survive the Imperial crackdown against criminal elements in the Outer Rim, as well as rid the Hutt of his competitors.
After the smuggler Han Solo failed to repay him for lost cargo, Jabba placed a high price on his head. Solo was eventually delivered to him by one of his bounty hunters, Boba Fett, as a gift from Darth Vader. However, this capture brought him to the attention of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who sought to rescue his friend from Jabba's imprisonment. As he attempted to execute the Jedi and his allies in the Great Pit of Carkoon, Jabba was choked to death by Leia Organa. With the Hutts unable to decide who would inherit Jabba's criminal ventures, many of his slaves, including the Niktos, were free, and his palace was abandoned after the droid pool was deactivated."
Wedge Antilles,170,77,brown,fair,hazel,21BBY,male,Corellia,Human,"Wedge Antilles, known as TIE SS-2-5 during his time at Skystrike Academy, was a renowned human male starfighter pilot from Corellia who first served in the Imperial Navy as a TIE fighter pilot until defecting to join the rebellion. He would also serve in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and years later the New Republic during their fight against the Galactic Empire. He became a member of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War and fought in several battles of the war. He fought in the Battle of Yavin, where he flew in Red Squadron alongside Luke Skywalker. After Skywalker destroyed the Death Star, he and Antilles were left as the only survivors of Red Squadron.
In the years that followed, Antilles became a respected member of Rogue Squadron, flying as Rogue Three during the Battle of Hoth. Antilles and his gunner Wes Janson became the first duo to successfully destroy one of the All Terrain Armored Transports that were attempting to destroy Echo Base, the Rebel outpost on the planet Hoth, while aboard an T-47 airspeeder. Six months after the evacuation from Hoth, Antilles commanded Red Squadron during the Battle of Endor, and he and General Lando Calrissian destroyed the second Death Star during the battle. The decisive battle led to the death of the Emperor, Darth Sidious, and left the Empire shattered in their defeat.
The Rebel Alliance soon reorganized into the New Republic, and Antilles continued to serve in their war against the now weakened Empire. Antilles undertook a lone reconnaissance mission to the planet Akiva, where he was captured while observing a gathering of Imperial forces that were preparing for a counterattack against the Republic. Following the rebellion on Akiva, Antilles formed Phantom Squadron and took part in the liberation of Kashyyyk. While Phantom Squadron was disbanded by the New Republic authorities for launching an unauthorized strike on Kashyyyk, Wedge was able to reform the squadron in time for the Battle of Jakku, which saw the definitive defeat of the Empire.
Following the signing of the Galactic Concordance, Antilles retired to Hosnian Prime to work as a flight instructor. Sometime afterwards Wedge married Norra Wexley and settled back on Akiva until they were visited by Norra's son Temmin and his wife Karé Kun during the war between the Resistance and the First Order.
In 35 ABY, Wedge fought alongside Rebel veterans Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca over Exegol against the Sith Eternal fleet of the resurrected Darth Sidious."
Jek Tono Porkins,180,110,brown,fair,blue,NA,male,Bestine IV,Human,"Jek Tono Porkins was a trader and pilot from Bestine IV who, along with the other Bestines, was forced to abandon his homeworld when the Galactic Empire chose it as the site of a new military base. Seeking the opportunity to strike back at the Empire, Porkins joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic and was assigned to Tierfon Rebel Outpost for pilot training with the Tierfon Yellow Aces. His skill at low-altitude strafing runs and his rotund physique earned him the nicknames ""Belly Runner"" and ""Piggy."" After the completion of the Empire's Death Star, the Yellow Aces were taken to fully active status and transferred to fill gaps in pilot rosters at other Rebel bases. When Porkins's good friend Wes Janson was taken ill with a case of Hesken Fever, Porkins was given his friend's assignment instead and transferred to Red Squadron, operating out of the Great Temple on Yavin 4.
Porkins soon took part in his first missions with Red Squadron, working with Biggs Darklighter, Wedge Antilles, and Cesi Eirriss to help retrieve a number of astromech droids from the smuggler Nera Dantels on Commenor. The group returned to Yavin 4 just before the arrival of the Death Star in the Yavin system, on a mission to destroy the Rebel base. Porkins flew as Red Six during the Battle of Yavin, his skills at strafing aiding the Rebels early in the battle. However, when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions, Porkins was hit by enemy turbolaser fire and killed."
Yoda,66,17,white,green,brown,896BBY,male,NA,Yoda's species,"Yoda, a Force-sensitive male being belonging to a mysterious species, was a legendary Jedi Master who witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Republic, followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order. Having lived through nine centuries of galactic history, he played integral roles in the Clone Wars, the rebirth of the Jedi through Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.
Born in 896 BBY, Yoda was almost nine hundred years old in the latter days of the Republic. A leading member of the Jedi High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the maverick Qui-Gon Jinn introduced Anakin Skywalker to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied Chosen One. The Jedi elders sensed that the boy was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the Jedi Code. After Jinn's death during the liberation of Naboo, the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Yoda's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same time, the Jedi discovered that their ancient nemesis, the Sith, had returned after a millennium in hiding. Aware of the Rule of Two, Yoda was convinced that at least one more Sith Lord remained active following Obi-Wan Kenobi's victory over the Sith apprentice Darth Maul.
Over the next decade, the galaxy was on the verge of civil war with entire star systems—led by Count Dooku, Yoda's one-time Padawan—threatening to secede from the Republic by 22 BBY. Unable to defend the entire Republic on their own, the Jedi took command of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic, with Yoda himself leading an army of clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the first battle of the Clone Wars. For three years Yoda led the Republic military's war effort as a Jedi General, determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict, but his efforts were undermined by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to power. After the Great Jedi Purge commenced in 19 BBY, killing thousands of Jedi both on Coruscant and across the galaxy, Yoda confronted the self-declared Galactic Emperor but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into exile, leaving the Sith Master to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Anakin Skywalker-turned-Darth Vader, at his side. His remaining years were spent living in isolation on the remote world of Dagobah until Anakin's son Luke Skywalker sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a Jedi Knight. A year later, with his health rapidly declining, Yoda died of old age and became one with the Force in 4 ABY."
Palpatine,170,75,grey,pale,yellow,82BBY,male,Naboo,Human,"Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, was a Force-sensitive Human male who served as the last Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and the first Emperor of the Galactic Empire. A Dark Lord of the Sith in the Order of the Sith Lords, recorded by history as the most successful who had ever lived, his deeds resulted in overthrow the ancient Republic and the noble Jedi Order from within. Noted for his sadistic and self-serving intentions just as well as his ability to conceal them, Palpatine impacted the galaxy perhaps more than any other single individual, and it is likely that his impact on history, for good or ill, was immeasurable.
Born in 82 BBY on the planet Naboo to the aristocratic House Palpatine, Palpatine discovered the Sith at a young age as a collector of dark side artifacts. In 65 BBY, he met Hego Damask, a Muun businessman who was in reality the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Under Plagueis's manipulation, Palpatine killed his father and pledged himself to his new Master's dark side teachings as Darth Sidious. Palpatine lived a double life for many years, serving an untarnished career as Naboo's ambassador in the Galactic Senate while learning from his master and training a young Zabrak as the Sith assassin Darth Maul. Plagueis and Sidious, both exceptionally skilled and powerful in the Force, were able to conceal their identities from the Jedi for decades. As Plagueis privately searched for the key to eternal life, Sidious manipulated galactic politics, culminating in the blockade of Naboo by the Trade Federation. In the wake of the political crisis, the Galactic Senate voted to elect him as Supreme Chancellor, and around the same time, in accordance with Bane's Rule of Two, Sidious murdered Plagueis and usurped the role of Sith Master.
As Chancellor of the Republic and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine orchestrated the outbreak of the devastating Clone Wars ten years after the Naboo Crisis. He himself headed both the Galactic Republic and, secretly, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The public leader of this splinter faction was former Jedi Master Count Dooku, Sidious's second apprentice as Darth Tyranus in the wake of Maul's presumed death on Naboo. As billions perished in the war, the vast majority of Republic citizens rallied behind Chancellor Palpatine, giving him enough support to amend the Galactic Constitution in the name of security and transfer most of the Senate's executive authority to his own office. In 19 BBY, following Tyranus' demise, Palpatine revealed his identity as Darth Sidious to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, telling that the dark side teachings that Plagueis had pursued could help Skywalker to save his wife, whom Skywalker had foreseen dying untimely. A failed attempt by the Jedi High Council to arrest Palpatine ensued, and Skywalker pledged himself to Sidious' teachings as Darth Vader. All members of the Jedi Order were accused of treason and betrayed by their clone troopers to the point of virtual extermination. Without the Jedi to oppose him, Sidious declared himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire, bringing an end to the Republic that had stood for over 25,000 years.
As Emperor, Sidious effectively wielded absolute control over the entire galaxy and virtually everyone who lived within it. During his tenure, he built one of the most powerful military forces the galaxy had ever seen and ruled unopposed for nearly two decades. Sidious progressively abandoned his facade of being an enlightened leader and began to rule through terror symbolized by the Death Star, a superweapon that could annihilate entire planets. However, he later discovered that Vader was training Galen Marek, an exceptionally powerful Force adept as a secret apprentice ""Starkiller."" When Sidious discovered Starkiller's existence in 3 BBY, he ordered Vader to fake Starkiller's death and then request that Starkiller assemble the most influential traitors in the Empire in a rebellion in order to highlight and destroy them all. Sidious's plan backfired when Starkiller, healed from his near-fatal injuries and espousing the teachings of the light side, vowed revenge against Sidious and confronted him on the Death Star, ultimately sacrificing himself in an act that inspired the dissident senators to create the Alliance to Restore the Republic. As the Galactic Civil War broke out, Emperor Palpatine ironically fought against a rebellion that he started in secret. After the Empire suffered a devastating defeat in 0 BBY, in which the Alliance destroyed the Death Star, the Emperor steadily began to lose his absolute control over the galaxy.
In 4 ABY, Sidious gambled his chances in order to annihilate the Rebel Alliance once and for all, allowing Rebel spies to learn of the existence of a second Death Star and its secret location near Endor. As expected, the Alliance fell for the bait and dispatched its fleet to destroy the Emperor, Vader, and the incomplete Death Star. With the Alliance soon falling for his trap, Sidious brought Luke Skywalker, the son of Darth Vader, before him in order to turn him over to the dark side and replace Vader with an apprentice who was younger and more powerful. After goading Skywalker to give into his frustrations with thoughts of the Alliance's defeat and the death of his friends, the Dark Lord eagerly watched as father and son fought one another. However, Skywalker refused to submit to the dark side and spared his father, prompting Sidious to unleash all of his rage and hatred on Skywalker. Unwilling to stand by and watch his son die from the agonizing effects of Sidious' Force lightning, Anakin Skywalker finally redeemed himself, throwing his astonished Master down the Death Star's shaft, a sacrifice that fulfilled the prophecy of the Chosen One and brought about the end of the Order of the Sith Lords.
Throughout the rest of the Galactic Civil War, the remnants of the Empire experienced a sharp decline while the Alliance reformed itself into the New Republic. However, Sidious did not stay dead, and eventually used a rare and ancient Force technique to transfer his spirit into one of many clone bodies stored on the Deep Core world of Byss. In 10 ABY, Darth Sidious resurfaced in the galaxy in a bid to rebuild his Empire, temporarily converting Luke Skywalker to the dark side and installing him as his apprentice. Sidious's efforts to live forever, however, were undermined by subversives within his own inner circle, including his Royal Guard Carnor Jax. With the last supplies of healthy clone bodies sabotaged and their genetic source material contaminated by his allies, Sidious desperately tried to take over the body of Darth Vader's youngest grandchild, the infant Anakin Solo, in 11 ABY. Sidious's spirit, however, was intercepted by the dying Jedi Knight Empatojayos Brand, who dragged the Dark Lord down into the depths of the Force forever, though his legacy continued to live for countless years."
Boba Fett,183,78.2,black,fair,brown,31.5BBY,male,Kamino,Human,"Boba Fett was a Mandalorian warrior and bounty hunter. He was the only unaltered clone of the famed Jango Fett, created in 32 BBY as unit A0050, one of the first of many Fett replicas designed to become part of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was raised as Jango's son. Jango taught Boba much, training him to become a skilled bounty hunter as was his father-figure before him. In 22 BBY, Jango was killed at the Battle of Geonosis, which opened the Clone Wars. Just a boy, Boba was forced to grow up and took to traveling the galaxy. Later, he became a bounty hunter and took assignments from beings such as Jabba the Hutt, and achieved notoriety despite his young age.
When the Empire was formed in 19 BBY, it was the perfect environment for Fett. During this time, he also married Sintas Vel and had a daughter named Ailyn Vel. Fett became known as the galaxy's best bounty hunter of the next several decades, often working for the Empire. He collaborated with Darth Vader on several occasions, and the Sith Lord even developed a grudging respect for Fett.
In 1 BBY, a year after the Galactic Civil War had begun, Fett was hired to kidnap the Rebel captain Juno Eclipse in order to lure out a clone of Galen Marek. Fett also participated in the Battle of Kamino. When Darth Vader was captured and about to be interrogated on Dantooine, the Mandalorian bounty hunter trailed the Rogue Shadow there.
Fett made his most notable bounty in 3 ABY, when he captured Rebel hero Han Solo, and delivered him to Jabba the Hutt. A year later, during the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fett fought against the group of Rebel rescuers. He was inadvertently knocked into the mouth of the Sarlacc by Solo. Though no one in recorded history had ever escaped from the Sarlacc, Fett was able to escape, though not unscathed. Thanks to his iron will and Mandalorian armor, he was able to fight his way out of the beast's belly. Back in action, he resumed his work as a bounty hunter.
After a promise made to a dying Fenn Shysa, Fett became Mandalore and eventually led the Mandalorians through the Yuuzhan Vong War. Originally working as a mercenary for the extra-galactic invaders, Fett later aided the New Republic in their battle against the aliens. When the Yuuzhan Vong assaulted Mandalore and bombarded the planet's surface, a large deposit of Mandalorian iron was unearthed, ironically helping to strengthen the Mandalorians.
Later, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Boba, who was still leading the Mandalorians, was plagued by ailing health. He found his granddaughter, Mirta Gev, and the two went on many missions together, even alongside Han Solo. Fett also trained Solo's daughter Jaina to kill her twin brother, Darth Caedus, and assisted the Jedi Coalition in several battles. Ultimately, Fett's training helped Jaina bring down Caedus, though an Imperial nanovirus attack prevented Fett from ever returning to Mandalore."
IG-88,200,140,none,metal,red,15BBY,none,NA,Droid,"IG-88, also known as IG-88B, or as a Phlutdroid, was a rogue, deadly masculine IG-series assassin droid manufactured by Holowan Laboratories who worked as a bounty hunter. Following the Battle of Hoth, he and several other bounty hunters were summoned by Darth Vader to the Executor and hired to track down the Millennium Falcon and her Rebel crew. Unable to track his quarry, IG-88 trailed his chief rival, Boba Fett, to Bespin, where the bounty hunter nearly destroyed the assassin droid, however IG-88 managed to survive. At some point IG-88 undertook a software infiltration into Death Star II, but his plan was single-handedly thwarted by R2-Q5. The droid later met with mercenary Bazine Netal to speak about the location of the Millennium Falcon."
Bossk,190,113,none,green,red,53BBY,male,Trandosha,Trandoshan,"Bossk (whose name meant ""devours his prey"" in Dosh) was a male Trandoshan bounty hunter who was the pilot of the Hound's Tooth and held the title of monarch of the Qotile system.[5] He was also an old enemy and rival for Chewbacca and his Human partner Han Solo. He would face them several times, and would unsurprisingly be one of the six bounty hunters Darth Vader hired to track down and capture the Millennium Falcon. Despite the fact that Bossk loved to hunt and skin Wookiees, he would unknowingly aid in the freeing of hundreds of Wookiee slaves on the island world of Lomabu III. He was also a frequent partner and foe of both Boba Fett and Zuckuss, both fellow bounty hunters. After being repeatedly beaten by Boba Fett, Bossk would eventually boost his reputation as a bounty hunter by defeating Fett on Tatooine."
Lando Calrissian,177,79,black,dark,brown,31BBY,male,Socorro,Human,"Lando Calrissian was a Human male professional gambler, entrepreneur, smuggler, and general throughout various points in his life. Born on Socorro, he became a gambler and con man early in his life and acquired his own ship, the Millennium Falcon, in a game of sabacc with a man named Cix Trouvee. He went on to have numerous adventures with the Falcon and its piloting droid, Vuffi Raa, during which he ran afoul of a Sorcerer of Tund named Rokur Gepta, whom Calrissian eventually killed. After a series of events led to him losing the Millennium Falcon to a Corellian named Han Solo on Bespin, Calrissian eventually became the Baron Administrator of Cloud City for a time—a position he once again gained through sabacc.
In 3 ABY, Cloud City was taken over by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as part of a deal gone wrong. Calrissian had previously agreed to turn over a group of Rebels to the Empire, including Han Solo and Leia Organa, as part of bait for a trap for Jedi Luke Skywalker. However, Darth Vader altered the deal to the point where Calrissian felt he was no longer able to tolerate it. Subsequently, he joined the Rebel Alliance and took part in numerous missions on its behalf; in particular, in search for Han Solo, who had been frozen in carbonite due to Calrissian's betrayal on Bespin. Calrissian eventually participated in Solo's rescue and the defeat of Jabba the Hutt. Following Solo's rescue, Calrissian continued to serve with the Alliance and during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Calrissian piloted his old ship, the Millennium Falcon, into the second Death Star's core to destroy its reactor.
Afterward, he continued to serve the newly formed New Republic in times of need, but spent most of his time pursuing various business ventures, specializing in mining. A venture on the sun-baked world of Nkllon was soured by multiple attacks from the Empire under Grand Admiral Thrawn, but Calrissian invested in a number of other entrepreneurial plans, including mining operations on Varn and Kessel. In 18 ABY, Calrissian met and fell in love with Tendra Risant, marrying her soon after the Bastion Accords were signed. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Calrissian aided the New Republic through his leadership and the YVH 1 droids that his company, Tendrando Arms, produced to combat the extragalactic invaders. He also helped to arrange the election of Cal Omas as Chief of State following the New Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Alliance.
Calrissian, along with his wife Tendra, continued to manage Tendrando Arms following the war. His YVH droids played significant roles in the subsequent Dark Nest Crisis, Swarm War, and Second Galactic Civil War. During the latter conflict, Calrissian aided his friends Han and Leia Solo in their efforts against their son Jacen Solo, who had fallen to the dark side and become a Sith, until Calrissian was informed that Tendra was pregnant; he then spent the rest of the war with her. After the war's conclusion, Calrissian settled down with Tendra in a life of quiet luxury, managing Tendrando Arms and raising his son, Lando Calrissian, Junior. He was later contacted by Luke Skywalker for assistance during a mission to the Maw with Skywalker's Sith allies. Calrissian reluctantly agreed, and successfully carried out the mission. Afterward, he returned to Coruscant and warned the Jedi of not only the danger posed by the Sith, but also the hidden menace which Skywalker and the Sith were pursuing. To that end, he assisted in getting a large number of Jedi StealthX wing starfighters offworld to assist the Skywalkers."
Lobot,175,79,none,light,blue,37BBY,male,Bespin,Human,"Lobot, also known by the nickname Lo, was a male human from the planet Bespin who, with the assistance of his AJ^6 cyborg construct, was paid to run battlefield calculations for the Galactic Empire. However, he eventually began working with the smuggler Lando Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon, running numerous criminal jobs. During one job, the theft of the Emperor's personal yacht, Lobot was gravely wounded by an Imperial Guard. In his injured state, Lobot's mind was lost and his cybernetic implants took over. In the time to come, Calrissian became Baron Administrator of Cloud City on Lobot's homeworld of Bespin, and Lobot served as his aide and chef. As the city's computer-liaison officer, his implants enabled him to communicate with the city's central network. During the Empire's takeover of Cloud City, Lando ordered Lobot to gather their security forces to outflank the stormtroopers. Although they successfully helped evacuate the city by rounding up the stormtroopers, the city soon fell to the Empire and Lobot was captured. Following the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor, Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard tightened his grip on the Anoat sector, home to Bespin, forming the Iron Blockade. Receiving support from the New Republic, Lobot fought to liberate his homeworld. "
Ackbar,180,83,none,brown mottle,orange,41BBY,male,Mon Cala,Mon Calamari,"Gial Ackbar was a veteran male Mon Calamari soldier and strong revolutionary leader during the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, the Cold War, and the war between the Resistance and the First Order. Throughout his sixty years of service, Ackbar was regarded as a brilliant tactician.
Ackbar was captain of the Mon Calamari Guard during the Clone Wars and fought in the Battle of Mon Cala, in which he helped to secure Prince Lee-Char's ascent as King of Mon Cala and repel the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ackbar became the foremost military commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, emerging as a symbol of defiance against the Empire's subjugation of non-humans. His presence attracted Mon Calamari support for the Alliance, thus supplying the Mon Calamari star cruisers that made up a bulk of the Alliance Fleet.
From his command ship of Home One, supreme commander Ackbar acted as the fleet commander during the Battle of Endor, in which the Alliance successfully mounted an attack that led to the destruction of the Empire's second Death Star and the death of Emperor Palpatine. After the Battle of Endor, the Alliance formed the New Republic. Ackbar became a fleet admiral of the New Republic Defense Fleet and led the Republic to its victory over the Empire during the Battle of Jakku. After the battle on Jakku ended, the Empire retreated into the Unknown Regions and Ackbar retired to Mon Cala.
By 34 ABY, the emerging threat of the First Order, which arose from the ashes of the Empire, led Princess Leia Organa to form the Resistance without the support of the Republic that had turned a blind eye to the First Order. Organa, the general of the Resistance, coaxed Ackbar out of his retirement to serve in the Resistance. After reclaiming his commission as an Admiral, Ackbar served in the Resistance base on D'Qar, where he helped oversee the battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base.
Ackbar was later present on the bridge of the Resistance's flagship the Raddus when the Resistance evacuated from D'Qar, but he was killed when two First Order TIE/sf space superiority fighters attacked the ship after it exited hyperspace."
Mon Mothma,150,NA,auburn,fair,blue,48BBY,female,Chandrila,Human,"Mon Mothma was a human female politician and revolutionary leader who served in the Galactic Senate and Imperial Senate as the representative of Chandrila, the leader of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and the first Chancellor of the New Republic. Mothma came to political prominence during the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars when, along with such allies as Senators Bail Organa and Padmé Amidala, she became an outspoken proponent of peace between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She also spoke out against the increase in executive power given to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who transformed the Republic into the Empire at the war's end.
Mothma worked with Organa and other allies to plant the seeds of rebellion against the Imperial regime. Mothma left the Senate after publicly denouncing Emperor Palpatine, which was soon followed by the establishment of the Rebel Alliance. Mothma sanctioned the recruitment of Jyn Erso, who led the Rogue One squadron in stealing the Death Star plans during the Battle of Scarif. After the Battle of Yavin saw the destruction of the Death Star, Mothma led the Alliance through the Galactic Civil War. The Battle of Endor, which Mothma helped plan with the Alliance High Command, saw the first death of Emperor Palpatine and left the Empire in chaos.
In Endor's aftermath, the Rebellion formed the New Republic and headquartered the new Galactic Senate on Chandrila. Mothma was elected as the first chancellor of the New Republic Senate and intended to do away with Palpatine's emergency powers, which the Senate gave to the office of the New Republic chancellery. She also intended to demilitarize the Republic, hoping to cut the New Republic Defense Fleet by ninety percent while leaving the defense of member worlds to the worlds themselves. When the war with the Empire finally came to end, the Republic and the Imperial remnants signed the Galactic Concordance and the Republic passed the Military Disarmament Act. The end of Mothma's chancellery brought a close to a period of unity in the Republic, with several political factions, such as the Centrists and the Populists, breaking out in disagreement over the best future for the new government."
Arvel Crynyd,NA,NA,brown,fair,brown,NA,male,NA,Human,"Arvel Crynyd was a male human pilot who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. In the war's fourth year, Commander Crynyd participated in the Rebellion's attack on the Galactic Empire's second Death Star in the Battle of Endor, flying an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor in Green Squadron as leader of the squadron. When Crynyd was killed during the battle in a suicide run to destroy the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar assumed command of the squadron. The battle ended soon after, seeing the destruction of the Death Star and death of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine.
Arvel Crynyd was a male human who flew as a Z-95 Headhunter pilot for a Thyferran bacta cartel before joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[3] With the Alliance, he fought in the Galactic Civil War, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire.[2] Holding the rank of commander,[4] Crynyd flew as a pilot in Green Squadron, operating an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor[2] In 4 ABY,[1] after the Bothan spynet discovered that Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine would be aboard the second Death Star to oversee its construction, Alliance High Command determined that launching an immediate assault on the space station would be their only chance to cripple the Empire.
With the full Alliance Fleet, Crynyd, under the callsign of Green Leader, exited hyperspace above the forest moon of Endor, approaching the superweapon in his A-wing. He was the last squadron leader to report stand-by status and prepared to attack the Death Star, but pulled up at the last second on General Lando Calrissian's orders when it was revealed that the shield was still up. Green Squadron was ordered to stick close to Sector MV-7 as a massive flotilla of Star Destroyers emerged from the other side of the moon. The Alliance had walked right into a trap, but were determined to go down fighting. Initially, both sides fought with only their starfighters to the rebels' confusion, but this turned to horror when the Death Star proved itself to be fully operational, firing its superlaser on the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty and reducing it to atoms. Following the advice of Calrissian, the remaining Rebel forces moved up alongside the Star Destroyers and fought at point-blank range, hoping the Death Star wouldn't dare shoot into its own fleet.
When the shield protecting the Death Star was disabled, several fighters broke off and headed for it to destroy the reactor. To buy them time, Crynyd and his squadron attacked the Imperial flagship, the mighty Super Star Destroyer Executor, with two A-wings knocking out its bridge deflector shields. In response, Admiral Firmus Piett ordered the forward batteries to increase forward firing to prevent any window of opportunity from being exploited. As Crynyd attempted a trench run through the ship's superstructure, his fighter was struck by a laser bolt and spun wildly. Realizing he was doomed, Crynyd managed to wrestle what little control he had over his starfighter and put it on a collision course with the Executor's unshielded bridge tower. Letting out one last cry of defiance, Crynyd's ship crashed through the bridge windows and exploded, killing himself alongside Piett and the entire bridge crew.
Without its command structure, the Executor lost primary power and plunged into the Death Star's gravity well, colliding with the station and detonating in a massive fireball. Crynyd's sacrifice tipped the battle in the Alliance's favor, with the Death Star being destroyed shortly after

The great-grandson of Erpham Warrick, Wicket was the third son of Deej and Shodu Warrick, following Weechee and Willy and was the older brother of Winda.
Wicket led an adventurous life, even from a very young age. He and his friends, namely Teebo and Princess Kneesaa, continually protected their village and the surrounding forest from those who would do them harm, such as Morag the Tulgah witch, the Duloks, and other threats from Endor and beyond. He almost even inadvertently killed Emperor Palpatine while defending the sunstar during Doctor Raygar's quest for Imperial domination.
Wicket aided the Towani family when they crash-landed on Endor and later assisted Noa Briqualon in the battle against the Sanyassans. Wicket also played an instrumental role in helping the Rebel Alliance defeat the Galactic Empire during the Battle of Endor. After the death of Chief Chirpa, Wicket and his bride, Kneesaa, ruled over Bright Tree Village together."
Nien Nunb,160,68,none,grey,black,NA,male,Sullust,Sullustan,"Nien Nunb was a Sullustan male arms dealer and smuggler who joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Nunb answered the call from his friend, Rebel pilot Evaan Verlaine, to help smuggle a group of Alderaanians off of Sullust while avoiding detection from the Galactic Empire; the Empire was searching for surviving Alderaanians after Death Star I blew up its first planet, Alderaan. He went on to further assist Verlaine and Princess Leia Organa in their mission to unite the surviving Alderaanians, during which time he helped Organa escape from potential Imperial captivity.
Only a few years later, Nunb became part of the Alliance Fleet and flew as the co-pilot for General Lando Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon during the Battle of Endor. Together, they fought against Imperial forces while attempting to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in orbit of the forest moon of Endor. Their battle was a success, and the Millennium Falcon fired the shot that destroyed the second Death Star and delivered a devastating blow to the Galactic Empire.
Three decades later, Nunb was a starfighter pilot with the military rank of Lieutenant Commander in the Resistance and fought in the Cold War, including the Battle of Starkiller Base. After the Battle of Crait Nunb was left as one of the few surviving Resistance members and successfully escaped with the remainder of the Resistance. One year later, in 35 ABY Nunb fought in the decisive battle against the Sith Eternal piloting the Tantive IV alongside Urcos Furdam. However, during the battle, the Tantive IV was disabled by Darth Sidious' massive burst of Force lightning and Nunb perished."
Qui-Gon Jinn,193,89,brown,fair,blue,92BBY,male,NA,Human,"Qui-Gon Jinn was a Force-sensitive highly respected, yet maverick and unconventional Human male Jedi Master, who lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic and was most notably responsible for discovering Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One of the Jedi prophecy, and bringing him into the Jedi Order. An adherent of the Living Force, Jinn always kept his focus in the moment and often clashed with and even openly defied the Jedi High Council. Born in 92 BBY, Qui-Gon Jinn was raised at the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant before being apprenticed at the age of ten to Jedi Knight Dooku. After years of training under Dooku, Jinn achieved the rank of Jedi Knight and—after successfully training a Padawan of his own, a farmer's son named Feemor—became a Jedi Master himself. Shortly after that, Jinn took on a second Padawan, a prodigy named Xanatos, whom Jinn had himself discovered and had brought to the Jedi Temple earlier. Jinn was marveled by his Padawan's prowess so much that he turned a blind eye to Xanatos's flaws, namely his desire for power.

However, Jinn was faced with his Padawan's true nature during a mission to stop a civil war on Xanatos's homeworld of Telos IV. During the mission, Xanatos fell to the dark side of the Force and sided with his father Crion, the power-hungry Governor of the planet, who had orchestrated the insurgency to further his own goals. In order to stop the war, Jinn had to confront Crion, who was accidentally killed in the process. Xanatos fled from the planet, swearing revenge on his Master. Devastated by his apprentice's betrayal, Jinn blamed himself for Xanatos's fall, believing in his inability as a Master and renouncing his earlier success with Feemor. Jinn swore never to take another apprentice, until he crossed paths with a Jedi trainee named Obi-Wan Kenobi during a mission to the planet Bandomeer in 44 BBY. Jinn took Kenobi as his third apprentice, starting their long training together. Over the course of the next twelve years, Jinn and Kenobi participated in numerous missions across the galaxy, most notably fighting side by side against Xanatos, who attempted to exact revenge on his former Master. Ultimately, the fallen apprentice took his own life when cornered by Jinn and his new Padawan on Telos, ending that dark chapter in Jinn's life.

In 32 BBY, Jinn and Kenobi were assigned by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum as ambassadors to the Trade Federation, which had recently blockaded the planet Naboo in protest against the recent taxation laws introduced by the Galactic Senate. The Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray, however, attempted to dispose of the Jedi, launching an invasion of Naboo. Escaping to the surface of the planet, Jinn and Kenobi saved the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, agreeing to escort her to Coruscant in order to report the Trade Federation's act of aggression, but their ship's hyperdrive was damaged, forcing them to make a stop for repairs on the lawless world of Tatooine. It was under the twin suns of Tatooine that Jinn discovered Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy with great Force potential, who helped the Jedi obtain the money to buy the replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator by risking his life at the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. Convinced that the boy was the Chosen One who was supposed to bring balance to the Force, Jinn secured Skywalker's release from slavery and brought him to the Jedi Temple, narrowly escaping from an attack by the Sith Lord Darth Maul in the process.

Believing that Kenobi was ready to become a Jedi Knight, Jinn asked for Skywalker to be assigned as his new apprentice. However, the Jedi Council refused Jinn's request, believing Skywalker to be too old for Jedi training and potentially dangerous. Jinn then accompanied Amidala back to Naboo, helping her to liberate her world from the Trade Federation. During the battle, Jinn and Kenobi faced off against Darth Maul, and the Jedi Master was struck down by the Sith, before Kenobi cut him in half. With his final words, Jinn asked Kenobi to train Skywalker as his Padawan. Following the battle, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and Skywalker was accepted into the Jedi Order. Kenobi fulfilled his promise to his later Master, training Skywalker for the next ten years. Even though Jinn died on Naboo, he continued to have great influence on the future of the Jedi. Having long ago learned how to preserve one's consciousness with the Force, Jinn remained as a Force ghost, eventually passing the secret to Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda. Even though Skywalker fell to the dark side—becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and leading to the fall of the Galactic Republic, the rise of the Galactic Empire in its stead and the near-destruction of the Jedi Order—he eventually fulfilled the prophecy just as Jinn had foreseen, killing his Sith Master Darth Sidious and returning to the light in his final moments."
Nute Gunray,191,90,none,mottled green,red,NA,male,Cato Neimoidia,Neimodian,"Nute Gunray was a Neimoidian male who served as a stint Minister of the Trade Federation until he rose in power after the Stark Hyperspace War in 44 BBY, eventually becoming Viceroy of the Trade Federation. In 32 BBY, Gunray participated in the occupation of Naboo with the Federation Army to settle a trade dispute that began in the Galactic Senate. With the help of Darth Sidious, Gunray invaded the planet to end the trade dispute and secured all facilities in the capital of Theed. He attempted to force the incumbent Queen of Naboo Padmé Amidala to sign a treaty to make his invasion legal, however she refused and the Siege of Naboo continued. The Trade Federation soon surrendered to Naboo forces following the Battle of Naboo. Gunray was taken to the Galactic Republic capital on Coruscant to be charged with acts of war.

During the Separatist Crisis that following the Invasion of Naboo, Gunray confronted former Jedi Master, Count Dooku, who began a separatist movement that opposed the Republic. Dooku, who secretly was Sidious's Sith apprentice under the name of Darth Tyranus, helped him through his four trials in the Supreme Court, and soon after the trials, Gunray retained his position as Viceroy. The Trade Federation, under Gunray's command, joined Dooku's separatist movement and Gunray was named Head of the newly formed Separatist Council and so formed the Separatist Army. Gunray, along with Dooku and his master, Sidious, formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems which opposed the Galactic Republic in a three-year war known as the Clone Wars that followed after two years of the Separatist Crisis.

During the Clone Wars, Gunray tempted Onaconda Farr, the senator of Rodia, with an offer to join the Separatists and receive the aid and protection for Rodia that the Republic had failed to provide, in exchange for Farr luring Senator Amidala to the planet and handing her over to him. Gunray's plan ultimately failed and he was captured by the Republic and given to Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Dooku sent his Dark Jedi apprentice, Asajj Ventress, to rescue the Viceroy from the Republic forces. Stationed inside the Republic Star Destroyer, Senate Commando Faro Argyus released the Viceroy and met up with Ventress in Argyus's cruiser. Argyus was betrayed and murdered by Ventress, however, in a fit of rage over his arrogance.

In 19 BBY, the Separatist Council was moved to the volcanic planet of Mustafar from the sink hole planet of Utapau, after Separatist General Grievous became leader of the CIS after the death of Dooku. Following the death of Grievous at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi Nute Gunray became the new leader of the separatists. Gunray along with the other Separatist leaders were betrayed by Darth Sidious after he sent his new apprentice, Darth Vader, to Mustafar to end the war. Gunray was the last council member to be killed by Vader's lightsaber, which had ultimately brought an end to the Clone Wars and fragmented the CIS into various Separatist holdouts, in which they were represented by various ununited warlords across the galaxy."
Finis Valorum,170,NA,blond,fair,blue,91BBY,male,Coruscant,Human,"Finis Valorum was a human male politician from House Valorum who served as the penultimate Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. His administration was hampered by corruption and bureaucracy in the Galactic Senate, which Valorum was unable to bring under control.

Towards the end of his administration, Valorum attempted to resolve the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo to little effect. As a result of government inaction, Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo called for a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum's leadership. The Senate scheduled an election for a new Chancellor, and Valorum was replaced by Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo; Palpatine was secretly Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, and had orchestrated the Naboo Crisis to become Supreme Chancellor and, ultimately, transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire.

During the Clone Wars, over ten years after his political downfall, Valorum assisted the Jedi Order as they investigated the circumstances surrounding the death of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who, as Chancellor, Valorum had sent on a mission to resolve a dispute with the spice dealers known as the Pyke Syndicate. The Jedi learned Sifo-Dyas had been killed by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of the Sith—who wanted to control the clone army Sifo-Dyas had secretly commissioned for the Republic—during the mission that Valorum had sent him on. After the rise of the Empire, some Coruscanti continued to have fond memories of the former Supreme Chancellor."
Jar Jar Binks,196,66,none,orange,orange,52BBY,male,Naboo,Gungan,"Jar Jar Binks was a Gungan male military commander and politician who played a key role in the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars that culminated in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Once an outcast from Gungan society due to his clumsy behavior, he regained favor with his people by helping secure an alliance between the Gungan boss Rugor Nass and Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo, an alliance vital in ending the Trade Federation's invasion of their shared homeworld. In the years that followed, Binks became a Junior Representative for his people in the Galactic Senate, serving alongside Amidala once she became the planet's senator.

Ten years after the Naboo Crisis, growing tensions between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems threatened an outbreak of full-scale galactic war. In the absence of Senator Amidala, whose life was under threat by Separatist assassins, Binks was convinced by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to propose that the chancellor receive emergency executive powers to raise a Grand Army of the Republic. The proposal passed, leading to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, during which time Binks participated in a number of diplomatic missions for the Galactic Senate.

The emergency powers Binks proposed were ultimately used by the chancellor, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, to amass total power and transform the Republic into the Empire. In the years that followed, Binks once again became an outcast on Naboo due to his role in the rise of the Empire. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Binks was a street performer in the capital city of Theed, where he was scorned by adults but beloved by the children who came to watch his antics."
Roos Tarpals,224,82,none,grey,orange,NA,male,Naboo,Gungan,"Roos Tarpals was a Gungan male who served in the Gungan Grand Army during the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, he served as captain of a patrol in Otoh Gunga. After the Battle of Naboo, Tarpals was promoted to general. During the Clone Wars, he sacrificed himself to protect Naboo from being conquered by General Grievous.
Roos Tarpals was a Gungan warrior who served in the Gungan Grand Army during the Invasion of Naboo. He was acquainted with Jar Jar Binks, who was banished from Otoh Gunga because of his ""clumsiness."" During the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo, Binks returned with two Jedi emissaries—Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi—who had come seeking help to get to the Naboo. Upon arriving, Tarpals and a colleague, who were riding kaadu, apprehended Binks. Tarpals warned Binks that he was in ""big doo-doo"" this time.[1]

Tarpals brought Binks and the two Jedi visitors before Boss Nass, the ruler of Otoh Gunga. Master Jinn saved Binks from punishment by enlisting his services as a guide to bring them to Theed, the capital of Naboo. Boss Nass reluctantly granted Binks clemency and sent him away. Later, Tarpals was present when the Naboo Queen Padmé Amidala convinced the Gungans and Naboo to put aside their differences so that they could defeat the Trade Federation invaders. As a reward for his role in bringing the Gungans and Naboo together, Jar Jar Binks was promoted to the position of Bombad General in the Gungan Grand Army.[1]

During the battle on the Grassy Plains, Tarpals served under the command of General Binks. Despite fighting bravely, the Grand Army was outnumbered and forced to retreat by the Trade Federation's droid army. During their chaotic retreat, Tarpals saved Binks from being killed by the battle droid commander of an AAT tank. Shortly thereafter, both Tarpals and Binks were captured by battle droids. However, the destruction of the orbiting Droid Control Ship disabled all of the battle droids, turning the tide of the battle in favor of the Gungans and their Naboo allies."
Rugor Nass,206,NA,none,green,orange,NA,male,Naboo,Gungan,"Rugor Nass was a Gungan male who served as the Boss of the Gungan people during the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo. Nass governed the Gungans from the city of Otoh Gunga within Naboo's oceans, keeping a close eye on Gungan affairs and, for a time, ensuring that the Gungans and the human population of Naboo did not interact. He initially refused to help the Naboo during the invasion, rejecting Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi when they requested it, but ultimately had a change of heart when Queen Padmé Amidala knelt and pleaded her case before him in behalf of the Naboo and the Gungans, promising that administration the planet's affairs would be shared between the two races from that time forth. After the Battle of Naboo, in which the Naboo and the Gungans were victorious over the Federation, Nass joined Queen Amidala in peace. Nass' tenure as Boss ended sometime before or during the Clone Wars, and he attended Amidala's funeral after her death at the end of the war."
Ric Olié,183,NA,brown,fair,blue,NA,male,Naboo,NA,"Ric Olié was a human male starship pilot who served in the Royal Naboo Security Forces. He was the commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps, and the leader of Bravo Flight. Olié's talents also landed him the job of the Queen's personal pilot, often flying the Naboo Royal Starship in the service of Padmé Amidala. Due to Naboo's pacifistic nature, Olié's skills were rarely in use, although he saw military action during the Invasion of Naboo. Following the battle, Olié suffered an inner-ear injury and was eventually succeeded as Naboo's royal pilot by Daneska Varbarós. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Olié had become part of the Amidalans, a resistance group of Naboo which desired to hunt down and kill those responsible for Amidala's mysterious death, facing the Sith Lord Darth Vader when the Sith was tricked into going to Naboo by Sabé so they could kill him for his role in the former queen's death."
Watto,137,NA,black,"blue, grey",yellow,NA,male,Toydaria,Toydarian,"Watto was a male Toydarian junk dealer/Human trafficker, who owned a shop in Mos Espa, Tatooine. In his youth, he served as a soldier in the Ossiki Confederacy Army on his homeworld of Toydaria, but later left after sustaining permanently damaging injuries. Making his way to Tatooine, he fell in with the Jawa natives of the planet, and learned how to trade from them. Once he felt he had learned all he could, he abandoned the Jawas, and set up Watto's Shop in Mos Espa. He became one of Tatooine's many slave owners, and made a lucrative business for himself. Eventually, he came into possession of a young slave, Anakin Skywalker, who proved to be a gifted mechanic, and an invaluable asset to the running of the store. Soon enough, Watto discovered that the boy had an affinity for podracing.

Watto would often bet on the podraces, and was an avid fan, so he had Anakin race for him in several tournaments. Although the boy never won, he was clearly gifted. During one particular race, Anakin destroyed Watto's own podracer, which incurred the Toydarian's wrath. Shortly thereafter, a stranger to Mos Espa, Qui-Gon Jinn, claimed that he had his own podracer, and that he wanted Anakin to fly it in the Boonta Eve Classic. Watto conceded to the deal, but decided to bet against Anakin, instead investing in the Dug Sebulba. Jinn took the bet, wagering his ship against Anakin's freedom. Ultimately, Anakin won the race, and Watto was left with very little. His business declined, and he eventually had to sell Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker. Watto stayed in business until the Galactic Civil War, when he handed over ownership of his shop to his assistant, W. Wald."
Sebulba,112,40,none,"grey, red",orange,NA,male,Malastare,Dug,"Sebulba was a male Dug who hailed from the planet of Malastare. A vicious podracer pilot who flew a massive orange podracer with a split-x configuration, Sebulba would often bump and smash his way through the competition. A skilled pilot in his own right, he nonetheless opted to install various illegal weapons on his podracer, such as a flamethrower built into the left engine, to ensure his victories on the track. The crowd favorite of a course known as the Boonta Eve Classic, located on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine, Sebulba maintained a strong rivalry with one of podracings few human participants, a young boy named Anakin Skywalker. A short while after the Invasion of Naboo, Sebulba and Skywalker competed in a Boonta race together.

Early in the race, Sebulba bested the competitor Mawhonic, before snuffing out more pilots during the second lap. After several more close calls, Sebulba and Skywalker eventually raced into the third lap neck and neck. The Dug nearly dispatched Skywalker near the end of the lap, but the Human regained his ground. The two continued the battle for first place until Sebulba crashed into the desert sands after his cockpit got tangled with Skywalker's engines. The wreck paved the way to victory lane for Skywalker, which earned the boy his freedom from slavery. Sebulba survived his wreck and continued to race into the Clone Wars. Sometime later Sebulba abandoned podracing and began a career in battle-racing."
Quarsh Panaka,183,NA,black,dark,brown,62BBY,male,Naboo,NA,"Quarsh Panaka was a Human male who served as the head of the Royal Naboo Security Forces before, during, and after the Invasion of Naboo, and later was the Moff for the Chommell sector during the Galactic Civil War. He was a vocal militarist among the peaceful people of Naboo, a fish out of water amongst his peers. Shaken by the murder of King Ars Veruna, he installed various security measures to make sure that the same thing did not happen to his second monarch, Queen Padmé Amidala. By learning from the mistakes of his predecessor, Maris Magneta, he was able to successfully defend her in several periods of danger, and continued to serve Naboo, the Republic, and eventually, the Empire.

Notoriously conservative, Panaka often clashed with the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn during the Invasion of Naboo, deriding the Jedi's controversial methods and retaining the utmost faith in his own. Nevertheless, with Jinn's help he was able to get his chance at military action, in the Battle of Naboo. Panaka thereafter became a staunch supporter of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and the New Order of the Galactic Empire, rising to the position of Moff of his home sector with Palpatine's patronage."
Shmi Skywalker,163,NA,black,fair,brown,72BBY,female,Tatooine,Human,"Shmi Skywalker Lars, formerly known as Shmi Skywalker, was a human female who lived in slavery on the planet Tatooine during the last years of the Galactic Republic. During her time as a slave, she gave birth to a child called Anakin Skywalker. In 32 BBY her son was discovered by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who found the boy to be unusually strong with the Force. He learned through Shmi that there was no father involved in Anakin's conception, leading Jinn to believe that Anakin was conceived by the midi-chlorians. With Shmi's support, Anakin was taken by Jinn to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and presented to the leaders of the Jedi Order as the Chosen One—the one who was destined to restore balance to the Force, according to Jedi prophecy.

After Anakin left Tatooine to begin his Jedi training, Shmi married Cliegg Lars—a moisture farmer who freed her from slavery—and became a loving stepmother to his son, Owen Lars. Her chance to see Anakin one last time came when, in the waning days of the Separatist Crisis, Shmi was abducted and subjected to torture by a group of Tusken Raiders in 22 BBY. By then, her son had returned to Tatooine as a Jedi Padawan. Having seen her son again, Shmi told him she was complete but died in his arms. Unable to prevent his mother's demise, Anakin gave into the dark side of the Force and massacred the Tusken Raiders, including their women and children, and buried his mother at the Lars moisture farm. Shortly after Shmi's death, her son went on to become a Jedi Knight, as well as a general in the Grand Army of the Republic during the galaxy-wide conflict known as the Clone Wars. The loss of his mother also pushed him to desire the ability to save his loved ones from death, which ultimately pushed Skywalker to become Darth Sidious's Sith apprentice."
Darth Maul,175,80,none,red,yellow,54BBY,male,Dathomir,Zabrak,"Maul, once known as Darth Maul, was a Force-sensitive Dathomirian Zabrak male who established himself as a crime lord during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Once, however, he was the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and deadly skilled in lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return to power despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.

Born during the era of the Galactic Republic, Maul was the son of Mother Talzin, leader of the Nightsisters of Dathomir, and also had a sibling, the Nightbrother Savage Opress. Sensing Maul's potential, Sidious took Talzin's son as an apprentice while he was still a child. Anointed by his Sith Master as Darth Maul, the Dathomirian was raised to hate the Jedi Knights that served the light side of the Force. Desiring to see the Jedi Order fall, Maul trained for the day when the Sith would exact revenge on their ancient foes. The time for revealing the Sith's continued existence to the Jedi came during the Invasion of Naboo, when Maul confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though he killed Jinn, Maul was, in turn, defeated by Kenobi, who bisected the Sith assassin at the waist. He was believed to be dead in the aftermath of the battle, but Maul ultimately survived, emerging a decade after his defeat at the height of the Clone Wars.

Despite learning that his Master took a new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, Maul still believed that he was a Sith Lord. Taking his brother as an apprentice, Maul and Opress held that they were the true Sith rather than Sidious and Tyranus. He then devised a scheme to seize power on the planet Mandalore, overthrowing the New Mandalorians and installing the Death Watch as the new ruling government. In addition to the Mandalorians, Maul expanded his criminal enterprise, the Shadow Collective, to include the Pyke Syndicate, Black Sun, and the Hutt Clan. However, as his power increased, Maul became a threat to his former Master's plan, resulting in a confrontation that concluded with Opress's demise and Maul's capture by Sidious. After escaping with the help of his Mandalorian super commandos, Maul resumed his reign on Mandalore until he was overthrown by the Grand Army of the Republic.

Maul survived the end of the Clone Wars, witnessing the Great Jedi Purge of Order 66 and Sidious's rise as Galactic Emperor. Chastened by his former Master on the principle of the Rule of Two, Maul abandoned his claim to the mantle of the Sith, focusing instead on building an empire of his own—the Crimson Dawn—by controlling the criminal underworld. Ultimately though, Maul remained driven by the desire for revenge, specifically against Sidious, the Master who disowned him, and Kenobi, the Jedi who defeated him. During his conflict with the Jedi fugitives Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, Maul tracked Kenobi to Tatooine, determined to finally end their rivalry for good. Their last lightsaber duel ended when the Jedi Master struck down his old nemesis. Believing that Kenobi had consigned himself to a life of exile to protect the Chosen One, Maul died taking comfort in the belief that he would be avenged once the Sith's prophesied destruction was realized."
Bib Fortuna,180,NA,none,pale,pink,NA,male,Ryloth,Twi'lek,"Bib Fortuna was a male Twi'lek who lived on the desert planet Tatooine. He served as Jabba the Hutt's majordomo and chief of staff for decades, handling all of the day-to-day operations at his master's palace.
A male Twi'lek, Bib Fortuna hailed from Ryloth, the homeworld of his species. He had at least one cousin, Beezer. At some point, Fortuna competed against Bidlo Kwerve to become the majordomo of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Fortuna also gave Jabba his pet rancor Pateesaas a birthday present. Ultimately, Fortuna succeeded and claimed the job whereas Kwerve ended up as an early victim of the rancor.
He served as Jabba's majordomo as far back as the time of the Invasion of Naboo, in 32 BBY. That year, Fortuna attended the Boonta Eve Classic, which his master hosted to commemorate the Boonta Eve holiday. From his master's private balcony, he witnessed the victory of a local human boy named Anakin Skywalker against the reigning champion Sebulba.

Ayla Secura,178,55,none,blue,hazel,48BBY,female,Ryloth,Twi'lek,"Aayla Secura, a Force-sensitive Rutian Twi'lek female, was a Jedi Master who served as a Jedi General of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Prior to the Clone Wars, Secura learned the ways of the Force as the Padawan of Jedi Master Quinlan Vos. With the outbreak of civil war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Secura and her fellow Jedi supported the Republic by becoming officers in its newly-formed military. As a general, she commanded the clone troopers of the 327th Star Corps, with Commander CC-5052 ""Bly"" serving at Secura's side.

Throughout the conflict, Secura fought alongside her soldiers in multiple battles across the galaxy, from Geonosis to Quell, Coruscant, and Felucia. As the war drew to an end, the clones were instructed by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to execute Order 66, resulting in a sudden purge of the Jedi Order at the hands of their own troopers. As a result, Secura was among the first casualties of the purge, having been shot in the back repeatedly by Bly and several other clone troopers.

The demise of Secura and many other Jedi was sensed through the Force by Grand Master Yoda, who survived the purge and ultimately escaped into exile, while the Galactic Empire rose to power in place of the Republic. Secura's death was also witnessed in a Force vision by Depa Billaba and her apprentice, Caleb Dume, on Kaller."
Dud Bolt,94,45,none,"blue, grey",yellow,NA,male,Vulpter,Vulptereen,"Dud Bolt was a Vulptereen male hit man and professional Podracer pilot during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. With a battered and scarred Vulptereen 327 Podracer at his disposal, Bolt maintained an aggressive on-course reputation. However, unbeknownst to most, the Vulptereen was employed as a mid-air bodyguard by the notorious Dug pilot and cheat Sebulba.

A competent pilot nevertheless, Bolt scored various race records on the planets of Malastare, Gamorr, Mon Calamari, and Sullust, and was even considered to be the crowd favorite for the Malastare 100 and a second Malastare based course. Bolt had also participated in the Boonta Eve Classic on the desert planet Tatooine at one point, and—alongside Sebulba—later returned to the event again during the year 32 BBY. Shortly before the race, Bolt aided Sebulba in sabotaging the Podracer of rival pilot Mars Guo.

Despite Bolt's and Sebulba's attempts at cheating, neither pilot finished the Boonta, with Bolt colliding into the Nuknog pilot Ark Roose. By the 24 BBY Podracing season, the Glymphid Aldar Beedo replaced Bolt as Sebulba's bodyguard, with both pilots subsequently earning crosshairs on their heads from a vengeful Bolt. The Vulptereen's career continued through 22 BBY, at which point he had furthered his fame to the planet Utapau and made enemies out pilot Clegg Holdfast and the crew of Team Watto."
Gasgano,122,NA,none,"white, blue",black,NA,male,Troiken,Xexto,"A Xexto male, Gasgano performed as a professional podracer pilot, flying a green Ord Pedrovia podracer. Gasgano raced for high-speed thrills, and his four spindly arms made him perfectly suited for racing, able to use all of his arms at once to pilot his pod. Extremely competitive, he disliked the prospect of losing, and joined the Boonta Eve Classic podrace on the desert planet Tatooine, which took place ten years prior to the intergalactic Clone Wars, in order to beat the local champion, the Dug Sebulba. Gasgano's competition also included two-time Boonta winner Boles Roor, returning Boonta competitor Dud Bolt, and the Er'Kit Ody Mandrell, who employed a team of record setting pit droids. Gasgano also had it in his mind to beat the human competitor Anakin Skywalker. The Boonta was held at the Mos Espa Grand Arena, and the Ord Pedrovia was placed in the middle of the third role, next to Roor's podracer, and directly behind Bolt's and Skywalker's racers.
The Troig race announcer Beed, speaking in Huttese, introduced Gasgano and his podracer shortly before the race's host, Jabba the Hutt, announced the official start of the race. The podracers darted off with the exception of two: Skywalker and Ben Quadinaros, both having stalled. It wasn't long before Gasgano was behind the leaders, having overtaken Mandrell, Roor, Bolt, and several other racers. Eventually, Skywalker repaired his podracer and entered the course, and overtook the pilots behind Gasgano. The crafty Xexto attempted to block Skywalker's attempts at passing, but was bested when the Human flew over the Ord Pedrovia following a cliff drop. Gasgano attempted to retake lost ground, and briefly overtook Skywalker after the Human lost a scuffle to Sebulba. However, the lead over Skywalker didn't last long, and Gasgano was trapped behind the two leaders. During the final stretch of the third lap, Sebulba crashed after a second tangle with Skywalker, allowing Gasgano to gain ground and beat at least one more competitor, albeit his last. Ultimately, Skywalker won the Boonta. Gasgano finished in second place."
Ben Quadinaros,163,65,none,"grey, green, yellow",orange,NA,male,Tund,Toong,"Ben Quadinaros was a Toong podracer pilot who had very little actual racing experience when he participated in the Boonta Eve Classic that saw the liberation of the slave boy Anakin Skywalker. Piloting a BT310 quadra-Podracer, Quadinaros never left the starting grid due to his pod stalling. A short while later, his power coupling failed, causing his engine's energy binders to deactivate. This caused the hapless Toong's engines to spiral away from the cockpit and fly off and explode on various parts of the Mos Espa Grand Arena. Despite this loss, Quadinaros continued to podrace up to ten years later, during the time of the Clone Wars."
Mace Windu,188,84,none,dark,brown,72BBY,male,Haruun Kal,Human,"Mace Windu, a Force-sensitive human male, was a revered Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in the corrupt, declining days of the Republic.

When the Separatist Crisis spawned the birth of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and sparked the Clone Wars, Windu and the Jedi rallied to the defense of the Republic and became the leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic. Throughout the war, Windu served the Jedi and the Republic in various capacities—on the battlefield in command of the clone army, on Coruscant as an overseer of the war effort and an advisor to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, and even as a diplomat to contested worlds, despite his disdain of politics. His exploits on the frontline served as a reminder of his reputation as a renowned Jedi warrior.

As the war drew to a close, Windu became increasingly suspicious of the chancellor's motives, as Palpatine had amassed near-dictatorial control over the Galactic Senate, and sensed the rising power of the dark side in the galaxy. His suspicions were confirmed when Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight and the Chosen One of ancient prophecy, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who manipulated the Republic and the Separatist Alliance into war. Windu, along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, confronted Palpatine with the intention of arresting him. Instead, the Dark Lord attacked them, striking them down one by one until only Windu was left. Windu bested Palpatine in the confrontation and—deciding the chancellor was too dangerous to be left alive due to his influence over the government—prepared to strike him down, but the intervention of Anakin Skywalker, who saved the chancellor's life, led to Windu's death. As a result, Skywalker fell to the temptation of the dark side and was renamed Darth Vader.

Windu's actions led Palpatine to brand the Jedi as traitors to the Republic. The chancellor executed Order 66 and clone troopers across the galaxy turned against and killed their Jedi leaders, marking the fall of the Jedi Order. Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and the Emperor's new regime promoted anti-Jedi sentiment across the galaxy. Through propaganda, the Empire portrayed Windu as the leader of a criminal gang of Jedi who caused the outbreak of the Clone Wars. In spite of the propaganda, some of Windu's actions were remembered with fondness; General Cham Syndulla, who served alongside Windu during the Battle of Ryloth, remembered Windu with great respect and told the tale of how Windu helped him liberate Ryloth during the war."
Ki-Adi-Mundi,198,82,white,pale,yellow,92BBY,male,Cerea,Cerean,"Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Force-sensitive male Cerean Jedi Master of the Jedi Order who served on the High Council in the twilight years of the Galactic Republic and played a major role in several battles during the Clone Wars. Born in 92 BBY, Mundi was discovered at age four by the Jedi An'ya Kuro and became one of the few permitted by the Jedi Order to be trained starting beyond infancy. After more than two decades as a Padawan to Master Yoda, Mundi was named a Jedi Knight and returned to Cerea to liberate his home village from a gang of raiders. Assigned the Jedi Watchman of the Cerean sector, Mundi was granted a rare exception to the Jedi Order's ban on marriage due to his species' low birth rate and had a polygamous family of five wives and seven children, although he tried to avoid developing emotional attachments to them.

Like many Cereans of his generation, Mundi favored his home world's isolation from the galaxy, speaking out against off-worlder technology and encouraging Cerea to maintain their independence from the Republic. Mundi was held in high regard by members of the Jedi High Council, on which he occasionally sat in during the absence of Master Micah Giiett. He was eventually offered a permanent seat on the Council despite not yet having obtained the rank of Jedi Master. Before accepting, Mundi rescued his daughter Sylvn from the captivity of an agent of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and in doing so uncovered a secret Cerean smuggling ring and illegal Trade Federation activities. Shortly after formally joining the Council in 33 BBY, Mundi was sent to seek the lost Jedi Sharad Hett on Tatooine. Following Hett's death, Mundi agreed to continue the Jedi training of his son, A'Sharad Hett.

While Mundi and Hett grew close, the Cerean eventually agreed to turn his training over to Kuro after Hett felt tempted by the dark side of the Force during a lightsaber duel with bounty hunter Aurra Sing. As the Confederacy of Independent Systems uprising threatened the stability of the Republic, Mundi was among the Jedi dispatched to Geonosis in 22 BBY to confront the Separatist Droid Army, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars. Now a Jedi General commanding the Galactic Marines branch of the Grand Army of the Republic, Mundi participated in several major battles, including the battle of Hypori, where he barely survived a lightsaber duel against General Grievous. Mundi's entire family was killed during the Battle of Cerea, but the Jedi overcame his grief by further committing to his Jedi duties. He briefly assumed the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker following Obi-Wan Kenobi's presumed death.

Mundi also dueled the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress on Coruscant after exposing a spy from within the Galactic Senate working with her. Along with Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, Mundi led an assault against several Separatist battle droid foundries on Geonosis. Following the assault Mundi earned the ""everlasting respect"" of Anakin Skywalker, as Mundi killed a total of 65 droids and Geonosians during the assault. As the Clone Wars approached conclusion, Mundi suggested to the Jedi High Council that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine may have become too powerful and that the Jedi Order might need to assume control of the Republic for an interim period until a transition of power could commence. Mundi was leading the Galactic Marines to battle on Mygeeto in 19 BBY when Palpatine began the Great Jedi Purge with Order 66, resulting in Mundi being shot to death by his own clone troopers."
Kit Fisto,196,87,none,green,black,NA,male,Glee Anselm,Nautolan,"Kit Fisto was a Nautolan Jedi Master during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Fisto was known as an expert swordsman, having some of the finest dueling skills in the Jedi Order. A celebrated fighter, Fisto served the Republic as a general for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. Fisto fought in various campaigns and over the course of the war was accepted as a member of the Jedi High Council.

Fisto took part in several battles during the early stages of the war, first serving in the opening conflict of the war on Geonosis and shortly thereafter in a covert operation on the planet Hissrich. Following the escape of Separatist leader Nute Gunray from Republic custody, Fisto and his former padawan, Nahdar Vebb, were tasked with tracking down the fugitive. Their mission went awry, however, as they instead ended up facing the notorious Jedi hunter and Separatist General Grievous in his lair. While Vebb perished at the hands of the General, Fisto very nearly bested him in combat, and escaped with his life, but without Gunray, ultimately making the mission a failure.

During a schism between the Mon Calamari and Quarren peoples on Mon Cala, Fisto was sent to aid the Mon Calamari against the Separatist-backed Quarren. The battle proved to be difficult, as the Separatists eventually overpowered the Republic forces. With a Separatist victory looming, Fisto and several others escaped into hiding, though he was eventually captured and tortured. The Mon Calamari and Quarren later rekindled their alliance and repelled the Separatists, aided by the freed Fisto. Following the Mon Cala campaign, Fisto took a more active role on the High Council. As the end of the war drew near, Anakin Skywalker revealed to Mace Windu that Chancellor Palpatine was a Sith Lord. Windu took Fisto and fellow Masters Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin to Palpatine's office to arrest him. The Dark Lord easily killed Kolar, Tiin, and Fisto within a matter of seconds, with Windu joining them soon after."
Eeth Koth,171,NA,black,brown,brown,NA,male,Iridonia,Zabrak,"Eeth Koth was a male Zabrak Jedi Master, and member of the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Iridonian Zabrak such as Eeth Koth were renowned for their mental discipline, which allowed them to tolerate great physical suffering. This ability was born of surviving their harsh environment. Koth was born in the violent slums of Nar Shaddaa, and was deemed too old to begin Jedi training at age four.

His natural abilities were his ticket into the Jedi Order, and Koth would go on to become a leading member of the Jedi Council. Koth participated in the Battle of Geonosis, the opening battle of the Clone Wars, as part of the Geonosis strike team consisting of 212 Jedi. Koth narrowly survived a LAAT gunship crash which took the life of Tarados Gon, and was initially believed to be dead following the battle. After returning to his duties, Koth would go on to lead his men in the Battle of Korriban. A chance encounter with the General of the Separatist Droid Army, Grievous, led to his capture in the Outer Rim. However, using sign language hidden in a holotransmission sent to the Jedi Council by Grievous, Koth led the Republic Navy to his location over Saleucami, where Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia freed Koth from his imprisonment, though not without escaping a trap by Grievous."
Adi Gallia,184,50,none,dark,blue,NA,female,Coruscant,Tholothian,"Adi Gallia was a female Tholothian Jedi Master during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic. Gallia was a respected member of the Jedi High Council, who served on that august body in the years leading up to the Clone Wars, as well as some time into that devastating conflict. Though the daughter of Corellian parents, Master Gallia was notable for wearing a traditional Tholoth headdress, suggesting she had ancestors from the planet Tholoth.

As a revered Jedi Master of the High Council, Gallia was naturally an exceptionally skilled member of the Order, who completed several notable assignments during her service to the galaxy. Gallia was a key player in the Stark Hyperspace War and served as the chief negotiator during talks aimed at mending ties between warring factions on Malastare. Gallia also participated in the opening battle of the Clone Wars, where her actions saved countless lives.

Despite her undoubted skill in combat, Master Gallia eventually fell to the blade of Nightbrother Savage Opress while fighting alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi on Florrum in 20 BBY. Kenobi would manage to partially avenge Gallia by using her lightsaber to sever Opress's left arm. She was succeeded on the Jedi Council by her cousin, Stass Allie."
Saesee Tiin,188,NA,none,pale,orange,NA,male,Iktotch,Iktotchi,"Saesee Tiin was a male Iktotchi Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi High Council in the last days of the Galactic Republic. Having apprenticed under the esteemed Jedi Master Omo Bouri, Tiin rarely spoke and kept to himself. Never choosing to take a Padawan himself, Tiin took the rank of Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.

Tiin fought in the Stark Hyperspace War in 44 BBY during the fifth battle on Qotile and also participated in the Yinchorri Uprising of 33 BBY. Some time after that, he and other Jedi tracked down the terrorist Nebula Front movement to their base on Asmeru. Tiin fought on many battlefronts during the Clone Wars on planets such as Lola Sayu, Gwori, Boz Pity, Diado, Geonosis, and The Rig.

A renowned starfighter ace, Tiin had been born on Iktotch, the moon of Iktotchon. Because of the battering winds of the moon, Tiin's species had adapted toughened skin and blunt features. Tiin was a starfighter instructor for younglings, where he taught many younglings the basics of flying. A natural telepath, Master Tiin failed to foresee his demise at the hands of the secret Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who in reality, was Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic. Tiin's death on Coruscant in 19 BBY alongside that of Mace Windu, Kit Fisto and Agen Kolar to Darth Sidious marked the start of the Great Jedi Purge and Order 66."
Yarael Poof,264,NA,none,white,yellow,NA,male,Quermia,Quermian,"Yarael Poof was a male Quermian Jedi Master and revered member of the Jedi High Council in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. Rather mischievous in his use of the Force, Master Poof was a consummate practitioner of the Affect Mind ability, thus limiting his need to wield his lightsaber.
Sitting on the High Council for years, Poof sacrificed his life in 27 BBY when he drew in the deadly powers of the Infant of Shaa to protect the citizens of Coruscant. His body rejoined the Force through cremation at the Jedi Temple's pyre.
As a Quermian, Poof's unusually long legs, body, and neck caused him to stand some three feet taller than other humanoid species. In addition to his upper arms, Poof had an additional set of delicate arms which he hid under his cloak. Possessing remarkable dexterity because of the extra set of limbs, Poof's sensitive olfactory glands were located in his hands. He had two brains, one located inside his skull and the other in his chest cavity. Out of the four Quermian Jedi enrolled in the Order at the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Poof was the most senior."
Plo Koon,188,80,none,orange,black,22BBY,male,Dorin,Kel Dor,"Plo Koon was a Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion.

Koon was a survivor of the First Battle of Geonosis, the opening salvo of the Clone Wars that claimed the lives nearly 200 Jedi. Early in the war he embarked on a mission to track down the Separatist warship Malevolence. Following several attempts to destroy the weapon, Koon and several of his peers managed to take it down. Among the Jedi he often worked with was Ahsoka Tano, whom he had discovered years before the war and shared a special bond with. During the war he played vital roles in the First and Second battles of Felucia, the Battle of Lola Sayu, and the Battle of Kadavo. As the conflict thickened, Ahsoka was framed for a terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple and was subsequently removed from the Jedi Order. When the true culprit was discovered, Koon and the Council offered her a chance to rejoin, but she refused and left the Jedi.

In the late stages of the Clone Wars, Koon led the 442nd Siege Battalion in the Battle of Cato Neimoidia. As he and a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters flew over the bridge cities following their victory, he was shot down and executed by his troops during the issuance of Order 66, during which the Jedi were massacred across the galaxy by their soldiers."
Mas Amedda,196,NA,none,blue,blue,NA,male,Champala,Chagrian,"Mas Amedda was a Chagrian male politician who served as the nominal leader of the Coruscant provisional government in the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War. During the Republic Era, he served as Vice Chair of the Galactic Senate from the chancellery of Finis Valorum to Sheev Palpatine. Amedda became the Grand Vizier of the Galactic Empire after Palpatine declared himself Galactic Emperor.

Amedda was from the planet Champala. He lived on the Core World Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Republic, where he served in Chancellor Valorum's government as Vice Chair. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Queen Padmé Amidala traveled to the galactic capital seeking Republic intervention against the Trade Federation's occupation of her homeworld. Although Valorum was removed from office by a Vote of No Confidence, Amedda retained his position under Palpatine, the senator of Naboo who was elected as the new Supreme Chancellor. He served as one of Palpatine's advisors during the Separatist Crisis; when Amedda recommended giving emergency powers to the Chancellor, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks successfully proposed the motion to the Senate, allowing Palpatine to organize legions of clone troopers from Kamino into the Grand Army of the Republic in 22 BBY.

Amedda continued to serve in the Office of the Chancellor during the Clone Wars, supporting Palpatine's decisions as a wartime leader. With the execution of Order 66 against the Jedi Order, Amedda witnessed the ascension of Palpatine—the Sith Lord Darth Sidious—as Emperor of the galaxy in 19 BBY. Amedda retained his power in the New Order, serving as Grand Vizier in the Imperial Ruling Council. After the Emperor was killed in 4 ABY, Amedda was forced to serve as a figurehead for Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-styled Counselor to the Empire. Following the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, Amedda surrendered the Empire to the New Republic by signing the Galactic Concordance. The Imperial government on Coruscant was replaced by a powerless provisional government with Amedda as its nominal leader. Amedda was remembered by history as a weak-willed sycophant of the Emperor."
Gregar Typho,185,85,black,dark,brown,NA,male,Naboo,Human,"Captain Gregar Typho was a Human male who served as head of security for Senator Padmé Amidala during the Separatist Crisis and Clone Wars. A quiet, simple man native to the backwater world of Naboo, Typho made a name for himself as a Junior Palace Guard during the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, in which he fought with distinction, suffering several injuries including the loss of his left eye. Typho then became the personal bodyguard and security advisor for Padmé Amidala in 24 BBY when she abdicated the throne and became a Senator; he inherited the position from his uncle, Quarsh Panaka, who served as Typho's mentor for much of his life. Typho quickly fell in love with the Senator, but he knew their social castes were too different for any relationship to form. When Amidala's life came under threat in 22 BBY, Typho's paranoia of an assassination attempt coinciding with the Senator's visit to Coruscant to vote on the Military Creation Act saved her life, when a decoy handmaiden was killed in her place. Typho continued to serve Amidala during the Clone Wars, traveling on several diplomatic missions for her.

In 19 BBY, Amidala went to Mustafar to find her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker—and never returned. A mourning Typho attended her funeral, feeling guilty for having let her go to Mustafar in the first place. He ultimately decided to travel to Coruscant to find her killer and avenge Amidala's death, but it was months before he could get leave from his duties. During this time, he worked with former Jedi Ferus Olin against the Empire on Naboo. A year after the Declaration of a New Order, Typho finally made it to Coruscant, and eventually came to the conclusion that Amidala had been ""killed"" by Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. Typho lured Vader into a trap and tried to kill him, but the Sith's command of the Force was too strong for him, and Vader killed Captain Typho."
Cordé,157,NA,brown,light,brown,NA,female,Naboo,Human,"Cordé was a Human female handmaiden and decoy for Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo during the end of the Separatist Crisis.
While Amidala was Queen of Naboo, the role of decoy was mainly filled by Sabé. Cordé replaced her when Amidala stepped down from the throne and became the Senatorial representative of the Chommell sector. Like Sabé, Cordé worked closely with Padmé, and the two women became close friends.
In 22 BBY, Cordé was killed in an assassination attempt on Amidala when the Senator returned to Coruscant for the Senate vote on the Military Creation Act. A Clawdite bounty hunter named Zam Wesell was responsible for the attack. One of Amidala's other handmaidens, Versé, and five Naboo guards were also killed in the blast.
Cordé died apologizing to Amidala, disheartened in thinking she had failed her duty to her mistress. On the contrary, the Senator was heartbroken by Cordé's sacrifice, regrettably accepting that she had performed her duty. At Captain Typho's insistence, Amidala reluctantly left the bodies of Cordé and the other victims behind, promising herself that their sacrifice would not be in vain."
Cliegg Lars,183,NA,brown,fair,blue,82BBY,male,Tatooine,Human,"Cliegg Lars was a human male moisture farmer from Tatooine. He had one son, Owen Lars, from his first marriage. In the years prior to the Clone Wars, he met Shmi Skywalker and freed her from slavery before marrying her. As such, he was the step-father of Anakin Skywalker, and the step-grandfather of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.

Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Shmi was captured by a band of Tusken Raiders. Lars and a number of other moisture farmers attempted to save her, but the sand people drove them back, and Lars lost his right leg as a result. Anakin Skywalker later arrived on Tatooine, having had visions through the Force of Shmi's suffering and met Lars. Skywalker found his mother, but she died in his arms and he returned her body to the Lars moisture farm for burial, where Lars said goodbye to his wife before dying sometime later."
Poggle the Lesser,183,80,none,green,yellow,NA,male,Geonosis,Geonosian,"Archduke Poggle the Lesser was the public leader of the Geonosians during the Clone Wars. Though subservient to Queen Karina the Great, he was nominally in control of the Stalgasin hive, and with his oversight of the Geonosian Baktoid battle droid factories, became a powerful figure within the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Archduke was a warlord, and commanded the droid armies that fought against the Republic during the first and second battles of Geonosis, the latter of which he was captured and brought into Republic custody. Incarcerated for two years on Coruscant, he was later recruited by the Republic Special Weapons Group to assist in the construction of the Ultimate Weapon battlestation the Geonosians designed; however, later absconded to Confederate space after sabotaging the project. During the final stages of the war, he and the rest of the Separatist Council were relocated to Utapau and later on Mustafar, where he was killed by Darth Vader."
Luminara Unduli,170,56.2,black,yellow,blue,58BBY,female,Mirial,Mirialan,"Luminara Unduli was a Force-sensitive Mirialan female Jedi Master during the final days of the Jedi Order. She commanded the 41st Elite Corps of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was the master of Padawan Barriss Offee. Together, they fought in numerous battlefields of the Clone Wars, before Offee turned against the Jedi Order and bombed the Jedi Temple.

At the end of the war, Unduli fought in the battle on Kashyyyk. She was arrested and executed after Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine issued Order 66 and destroyed the Jedi Order. The Galactic Empire would later use her remains to attract and kill any Jedi that survived Order 66. One such trap was laid for Kanan Jarrus and the crew of the Ghost, who believed Unduli was alive and being imprisoned on Stygeon Prime. They mounted a rescue mission, only to discover that it was a trap by the Grand Inquisitor. The rebels escaped with the knowledge that Unduli was dead and spread the word to dispel the ruse, preventing any more deaths in her name."
Barriss Offee,166,50,black,yellow,blue,40BBY,female,Mirial,Mirialan,"Barriss Offee was a Force-sensitive female Mirialan who trained as a Jedi Padawan during the Clone Wars. She carried a blue lightsaber and trained under Jedi Master Luminara Unduli. Offee participated in the First Battle of Geonosis that began the Clone Wars and continued to serve alognside Unduli throughout the war. Offee preferred studying ancient Jedi texts to fighting. During her time as a Jedi Padawan, Offee struck up a friendship with Ahsoka Tano, the Padawan learner of Anakin Skywalker. Though rather different in personality, the two bonded through shared experience in combat, inluding at the Second Battle of Geonosis.

As the Clone Wars continued, Offee grew disillusioned with the Jedi's role in the wars, believing they had lost their way from the ideals that the Jedi Order was supposed to represent, and wary of the Jedi Council in particular. Deciding to act on her concerns, she orchestrated the bombing of the Jedi Temple as a means to foment further distrust of the Jedi. Despite their previous friendship, she allowed Tano to be framed for orchestrating the bombing, but ultimately confessed after being confronted by Anakin Skywalker, just before Tano was about to be convicted of the crime, even going as far to impersonate former Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress to frame her former friend. However, Tano's master, Anakin Skywalker, ended up catching Offee and bringing her to justice, clearing his Padawan's name. Offee expressed her views of the Jedi Order in front of the tribunal, showing that she had been corrupted by the dark side before being taken away."
Dormé,165,NA,brown,light,brown,NA,female,Naboo,Human,"Dormé was a Human female from Naboo and one of the most devoted handmaidens of Padmé Amidala during the former Queen's time as the Senatorial representative of the Chommell sector in the Galactic Senate.
While on Coruscant with Padmé Amidala in the leadup to voting on the Military Creation Act, Dormé noticed the growing affection between the Senator and the Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker as she watched from the sidelines.
When Senator Amidala was forced to flee the Galactic Republic capital with Skywalker and R2-D2, Dormé remained behind, along with Captain Gregar Typho, in order to maintain the illusion that Padmé was still on the planet and thus throw off further assassination attempts.
Though fellow handmaidens Cordé and Versé had perished during an earlier attempt on the Senator's life, Dormé was willing to put her duty before her own safety in order to act as a decoy for the former monarch during the last days of peace before the beginning of the Clone Wars."
Dooku,193,80,white,fair,brown,102BBY,male,Serenno,Human,"Dooku, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Master that fell to the dark side of the Force and became the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tyranus during the final years of the Galactic Republic. After leaving the Jedi Order, he claimed the title Count of Serenno and, during the Clone Wars, served as Head of State of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He was the second apprentice of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith whose plan to conquer the galaxy relied on Dooku leading a pan-galactic secessionist movement against the Republic. As such, Dooku immersed himself in the dark side and worked tirelessly to advance his master's plans, but ultimately forgot that treachery was the way of the Sith.

Born in 102 BBY during the Age of the Republic, Dooku was taken by the Jedi Order after being abandoned by his family and learned the Jedi arts as the Padawan of Yoda, the legendary Grand Master of the Jedi Order. A political idealist, the corruption in the Galactic Senate—as well as the traditions of the Jedi—disillusioned him, causing Dooku to voluntarily leave the Order and return to his homeworld where he reclaimed his title and heritage as a nobleman. His former peers believed his decision was misguided but still held him in high esteem. Unknown to the Jedi, however, Dooku not only renounced their ways but his commitment to the light side of the Force as well. Having sworn his allegiance to Darth Sidious, Dooku became the Dark Lord's apprentice and adopted the secret name of Darth Tyranus. Throughout the first decade of Sheev Palpatine's chancellery, Dooku used his resources and charisma to recruit entire star systems to the Separatist cause. At the same time, he oversaw the development of two vast armies that would be pitted against each other in the conflict to come: the Separatist Droid Army, which consisted entirely of battle droids manufactured on Geonosis; and the Grand Army of the Republic, composed by clone troopers bred on Kamino and modeled on the bounty hunter Jango Fett.

After years of maneuvering the galaxy into a state of war, the Clone Wars began when the newly formed Republic Military invaded Geonosis in 22 BBY. As leader of the Separatists, Dooku delegated military authority to a cadre of subordinates personally trained by himself, including General Grievous and Asajj Ventress. While Grievous was trained only in the art of lightsaber combat, Ventress was strong with the Force, affording her the opportunity to learn the ways of the dark side from Dooku. The Sith, however, remained faithful to Darth Bane's Rule of Two; and as such, Dooku was compelled to betray his disciple after Sidious became suspicious of his own apprentice's intentions. Though he sought to replace Ventress with Savage Opress and later Quinlan Vos, Dooku ultimately remained beholden to his master's will. By the third year of the war, Dooku and Grievous succeeded in abducting Chancellor Palpatine from the Republic capital of Coruscant in 19 BBY. During the ensuing Battle of Coruscant, he was confronted and defeated by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who summarily executed the Count via beheading at the Chancellor's behest. In the days following Dooku's death, Palpatine revealed to the Jedi that he was, in fact, Darth Sidious, who betrayed his apprentice in order to replace him with Skywalker. With the subsequent fall of the Jedi Order, Sidious consolidated his power upon declaring himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire. As for Skywalker, he succeeded the late Darth Tyranus as Sidious's third and last apprentice, resulting in his transformation into Darth Vader and proving his slain victim's words of sensing fear, hate and anger."
Bail Prestor Organa,191,NA,black,tan,brown,67BBY,male,Alderaan,Human,"Bail Organa was a human male Alderaanian politician, an influential voice for peace in the Galactic Senate during the last days of the Galactic Republic, and a founding member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Organa, the senator of Alderaan, was an outspoken member of the Senate's Loyalist Committee that pushed to maintain the ideals of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He became an architect of the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and believed that a full-scale Galactic Civil War was inevitable if the Empire was to be toppled and replaced by a New Republic.

During the Clone Wars, Organa often worked closely with Senators Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila in an attempt to de-escalate the war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and bring about a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the years-long conflict. He was an opponent of the Republic military enhancement bill that increased the production of clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the architect of the Alderaan Refugee Conference to deal with the refugees displaced by the war with the Separatist Alliance. At times he became caught in the action of the war, including when his relief effort on Christophsis fell under Separatist siege shortly before the Battle of Christophsis. He also ensured that relief supplies could be delivered to the citizens of Ryloth during the Separatist occupation of the planet.

After the transformation of the Republic into the Empire, Organa continued to serve in the Imperial Senate but quietly began organizing a rebel movement to combat the Empire. He and his wife, Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan, secretly adopted Leia Organa, who came into their care after her mother, Senator Amidala, died and her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, fell to the dark side of the Force. Princess Leia followed in her father's footsteps and succeeded him in the Senate while quietly supporting the Rebel Alliance. Organa tasked her with finding Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, his old friend and ally, in exile on Tatooine and bringing him into the fight. Bail then returned home to Alderaan to inform his people that war was coming, a warning that would come too late. Shortly thereafter, Organa and the queen were killed when the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon, destroyed Alderaan. They were remembered fondly by the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic as revolutionaries who fought to restore peace and freedom in the galaxy."
Jango Fett,183,79,black,tan,brown,66BBY,male,Concord Dawn,Human,"Jango Fett was a human male bounty hunter and the clone template of the Grand Army of the Republic. Considered the best in his profession during the final years of the Galactic Republic, Fett was proficient in marksmanship as well as unarmed combat. The Mandalorian armor that he wore featured various weapons and gadgets, including a flamethrower, dual WESTAR-34 blaster pistols and a jetpack. His personal starship was the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I.

Though allegedly from the planet Concord Dawn, Fett was not Mandalorian but a common mercenary according to the government of Mandalore. Prior to the Clone Wars, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus hired Fett to serve as the genetic foundation of an army secretly bred on the extragalactic world of Kamino. His DNA spawned millions of clone troopers who shared his face, voice, and were trained to become soldiers. As part of his payment, Fett was given an unaltered clone whom he raised as his son, Boba Fett. In the last days of the Separatist Crisis, Fett was involved in the failed plot to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala on Coruscant. The Jedi Order investigated the incident, forcing Fett to leave the Kaminoan homeworld after he was confronted by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Kenobi tracked Fett to Geonosis where he discovered the bounty hunter's connection with Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Fett fought against the Jedi assault team during the First Battle of Geonosis, and was killed by Jedi Master Mace Windu in 22 BBY. His legacy survived not only through the millions of clone troopers that formed the backbone of the Republic Military, but also Boba, who became a bounty hunter like his father before him. By the era of the Galactic Empire, Boba possessed his own Mandalorian armor that was similar to the one worn by Jango."
Zam Wesell,168,55,blonde,"fair, green, yellow",yellow,NA,female,Zolan,Clawdite,"Zam Wesell (pronounced /zæm.w?z??l/ or /zæm.?w?s•?l/) was a shapeshifting Clawdite bounty hunter from the planet Zolan. In her true form, Wesell was a reptilian-like humanoid, although she often appeared as a Human woman with short blonde or bronze-colored hair. She trained in the ways of the Mabari warriors on her homeworld before eventually being labeled a heretic and fleeing to the commercial center of Denon. To escape, Wesell took the form of a human woman and took a job in personal security. Over time, she moved up through the ranks by honing her skills, gathering equipment, garnering finances and making valuable contacts which altogether allowed her to begin a career in bounty hunting.
Wesell first encountered the bounty hunter Jango Fett in 32 BBY during his search for Bando Gora outlaw leader Komari Vosa. After assisting Fett in his scheme to defeat Vosa, the two began to develop a friendship that was propagated by their periodic partnership on various contracts. One such contract arose in 27 BBY when the two bounty hunters were seeking the Infant of Shaa ancient artifact and superweapon on behalf of the Dug Fernooda. Originally pitted against each other, the pair agreed to work together to capture the idol. It was then revealed to Wesell that a seedy underworld general planned to use it to destroy the Republic capital world of Coruscant. At Wesell's lead, Fett joined in the hunt to retrieve the artifact and save Coruscant. During this incident, Wesell made use of her developed shapeshifting abilities. This skill was also employed in her other exploits, such as the hunt for Kuati Hurlo Holowan, which was subcontracted by Jango Fett.
In 22 BBY, with the rise of the Separatist Crisis, Confederate leader Count Dooku contracted Jango Fett to eliminate Senator Padmé Amidala on behalf of Nute Gunray. In turn, Fett subcontracted the bounty to Wesell, who attempted to kill the senator by destroying the senator's starship with an explosive device. The explosion, however, only served to kill Amidala's decoy and other passengers aboard the vessel. Amidala had arrived separately on another ship and was unscathed by the blast. Not pleased, but undeterred, Wesell met with Fett and schemed to use two venomous arthropods to kill the vulnerable senator. The attempt was foiled, however, by the alert presence of Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi who had been stationed in the senator's apartment. The Jedi easily killed the arthropods and Kenobi leaped through the apartment window to grab hold of the droid which Wesell had used to deliver the predators.
The droid began its return to Wesell, but the bounty hunter spotted the stowaway Jedi. Skywalker, at the same time, commandeered an airspeeder and began pursuit. After chasing Wesell through the skylanes of Coruscant, Skywalker was able to force the Clawdite to crash her airspeeder in a busy street of the Uscru Entertainment District. Wesell fled into a nearby locale and prepared to ambush the Jedi. She approached Kenobi from behind but was easily defeated and dragged from the club into a neighboring alley. There, she was silenced by her friend, Jango Fett, with a toxic dart before she could divulge his identity."
Dexter Jettster,198,102,none,brown,yellow,NA,male,Ojom,Besalisk,"Dexter ""Dex"" Jettster, nicknamed Dexi Jet, was a male Besalisk with a colorful background who lived on the planet Coruscant and was the owner of Dex's Diner. Serving mostly hard workers from the area, the diner offered home-style cooked meals and freshly brewed ardees (""Jawa juice""). Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses, Hermione Bagwa and her WA-7 waitress droid partner, FLO.
It was shortly before the Clone Wars that Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend, Jettster, could identify a poisoned dart. Though few even knew of the planet Kamino, Jettster did from his days as a prospector on Subterrel and was able to identify the dart as originating from Kamino. Furthermore, he knew of the native inhabitants, the Kaminoans, who were cloners of some repute and kept to themselves but were welcoming to those who brought credits. Jettster gently chided his old friend Kenobi who as a Jedi should have put more faith in another person's wisdom than the knowledge of the Jedi Archives."
Lama Su,229,88,none,grey,black,NA,male,Kamino,Kaminoan,"Lama Su was a male Kaminoan who hailed from a race of expert cloners on the planet Kamino. As Prime Minister, he personally oversaw the creation of the clone troopers—the new army of the Galactic Republic—from Tipoca City, the capital of his homeworld. Although Kamino's contribution to the Republic Military gained Lama Su's people a seat in the Galactic Senate during the Clone Wars, their actions were also partially responsible for the systematic extermination of the Jedi Order and the rise of Darth Sidious's Galactic Empire."
Taun We,213,NA,none,grey,black,NA,female,Kamino,Kaminoan,"Taun We was a female Kaminoan who hailed from Kamino, an extragalactic world noted for its major cloning facilities. As the administrative aide of Prime Minister Lama Su, she was closely involved in the creation of the clone troopers, an army of elite soldiers bred to serve the Galactic Republic.
Approximately ten years before the Battle of Geonosis, Taun We and her people were hired by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic. In addition to her duties as administrative aide to Prime Minister Lama Su of Kamino, she also served as Project Coordinator for the Republic clone troopers. She closely monitored the development of the rank-and-file soldiers, as well as the training of a special unit known as clone commandos.
During the accelerated growth and training process of the clone troopers, Taun We also acted as a guardian to Boba Fett, an unmodified clone of Jango Fett, the bounty hunter who had been selected to become the army's template. Whereas Fett felt no emotional sentiments toward the rest of his copies, he regarded Boba as the only ""true clone;"" a son to be raised and cared for. With only two other female influences—MU-12 and Zam Wesell—in Boba's life, Taun We became a virtual ""surrogate mother"" to Fett's son."
Jocasta Nu,167,NA,white,fair,blue,NA,female,Coruscant,Human,"Jocasta Nu, a Force-sensitive human female, was a Jedi Master who served as the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives during the Clone Wars. In this role, Nu would assist fellow Jedi in finding information they needed from the Jedi Archives, and controlled access to the restricted Holocron Vault. Sometime prior to the Invasion of Naboo, Nu sat on the Jedi Council. Shortly before the war, she assisted Obi-Wan Kenobi in his attempt to locate the planet Kamino in the Archives. After not finding any information, and Nu's insistence that any item that did not appear in the Archives did not exist, it was determined that information about Kamino had been erased from Jedi records. During the war, Nu was attacked by bounty hunter Cato Parasitti, who was helping Cad Bane steal a holocron from the Holocron Vault. She later assisted Ahsoka Tano in finding the thief who stole the Padawan's lightsaber.

After the fall of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, and the rise of the Galactic Empire in their place, Nu survived the purge of the Jedi unlike many of her fellows and went into hiding, all the while attempting to preserve what she could of the Jedi. Determined to put a permanent end to the Jedi, the newly crowned Emperor dispatched his agents in the form of Darth Vader and the Inquisitorius to hunt her down, a hunt which culminated with Nu's death at the hands of Vader."

Tyerell had a drive to beat the reigning champion, the Dug, Sebulba. During the race, Tyerell flew into the Laguna Caves, where his accelerator jammed. Unable to control his podracer, the little Aleena could only throw his arms into the air and scream as he fatally collided with a stalactite. His family was reportedly seen mourning after the race's conclusion.
A male Aleena from the planet of Aleen, the diminutive Ratts Tyerell took on the role of a professional podracer pilot, making up for his small stature with a podracer with large, oversized engines. Utilizing a team of Aleena mechanics, Tyerell toured alongside his family. Tyerell's profession earned him immense popularity on his homeworld, and was sometimes considered to be Aleen's most famous native. A small toy based off of Tyerell's podracer was also produced at some point. Tyerell eventually headed to the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine to participate in the world's largest annual podrace, the Boonta Eve Classic. The race was concurrent with an invasion on the neighboring planet of Naboo. Only a little while before the race, Tyerell's wife gave birth to a third child, a fact that eventually found its way to the race commentators Fode and Beed"

R4-P17 was manufactured by Industrial Automaton sometime prior to the Clone Wars. A model of the R4-P sub-line of the R4 astromech, the feminine astromech droid accompanied Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to Kamino and Geonosis as the Jedi sought to uncover the mysteries behind the assassination attempts on Naboo senator Padmé Amidala that occured on the galactic capital Coruscant.
During the final days of the Clone Wars, R4-P17 joined Obi-Wan Kenobi once again aboard his Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor in a battle above Coruscant. During the battle, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker approached Separatist General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand, in an attempt to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. As the two Jedi neared the flagship they encountered attacks from Pistoeka sabotage droids; during the attack, R4's dome was torn apart by a buzz droid, ending her career.
She was later replaced by R4-G9 as Kenobi's companion droid during his travel to the planet Utapau."
Wat Tambor,193,48,none,"green, grey",NA,NA,male,Skako,Skakoan,"Wat Tambor was a male Skakoan who was the foreman of the Techno Union and an executive of Baktoid Armor Workshop. During the Separatist Crisis, he pledged the Techno Union's resources to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, earning himself a seat on the Separatist Council during the Clone Wars. In the conflict's early stages, Tambor was appointed emir of Ryloth and supervised its occupation by the Separatists, which was fiercely resisted by local Twi'lek freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla. After defying orders to abandon Ryloth when the tide of battle turned against the Separatists, Tambor was left behind and captured by the Galactic Republic. He was briefly imprisoned on Coruscant before being liberated later in the conflict.

As the Clone Wars escalated, Wat Tambor took an interest in the captive ARC trooper CT-1409, who had been captured during a battle in the Citadel but was presumed dead by the Republic. Tambor kept an unconscious Echo in a stasis chamber and managed to extract information from Echo's mind to use as an algorithm consisting of strategies devised by Echo and the Clone Captain CT-7567. While officially professing the Techno Union's neutrality, Tambor had sold the algorithm to the Separatist Admiral Trench, who used it to great effect during the Battle of Anaxes to invade the Republic world of Anaxes. Tambor's dealings with the Separatists were exposed by a Republic infiltration team consisting of Rex, Clone Force 99, and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.

During the final days of the Clone Wars, Wat Tambor and the rest of the Separatist Council relocated from the planet Utapau to Mustafar, where they were slaughtered by Darth Vader. Following his demise, the newly-formed Galactic Empire assumed control of the Techno Union's assets."

Shaak Ti,178,57,none,"red, blue, white",black,NA,female,Shili,Togruta,"Shaak Ti was a Togruta Jedi Master and member of the Jedi Order and Jedi High Council in the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Considered to be amongst the wisest and most patient in the Order, she was a skilled fighter and devoted believer in the ways of the Jedi. During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ti took part in the pivotal battles of Geonosis, Kamino, and Coruscant as a general for the Grand Army of the Republic.

Early in the Clone Wars, she was chosen to represent the Republic on Kamino, where she personally oversaw the training and development of clone forces. While in this role, she became entangled in a conspiracy surrounding the origins of the organic inhibitor chips placed in every clone, and the secrets being kept from the Jedi about them. As she attempted to root out the conspiracy from ARC Trooper Fives, she clashed with Kaminoan Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se, who was attempting to dispel his claims regarding the chips' true purpose. Despite her efforts to the contrary, Ti was unable to help Fives as he suffered a breakdown, and upon his death, his secrets passed on to only a few. Ti had a tenuous relationship with the Kaminoan leadership during this time, finding difficulty in working with their emotionless demeanor and struggling to balance her compassion for the clones with the demand of producing capable soldiers for war.

As the war began to draw to a close, Ti and the Council became increasingly aware of the mystery behind the Dark Lord of the Sith, devoting much time to discovering their identity and motives. During the Battle of Coruscant in the late stages of the Clone Wars, Ti was sent to protect Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine but was knocked unconscious in a duel with Separatist General Grievous. At the war's end Ti became a victim of the Great Jedi Purge, murdered at the hands of fallen Jedi Anakin Skywalker whilst she meditated during the Siege of the Jedi Temple. Prior to her death Ti recorded a message of hope on a holocron, urging its finder to not let the fall of the Order be the end of the Jedi."
Grievous,216,159,none,"brown, white","green, yellow",NA,male,Kalee,Kaleesh,"Grievous, formerly known as Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a Kaleesh male warlord who served as a commanding officer in the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Although he was known by his rank as a general, Grievous was the Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army that engaged the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the pan-galactic conflict of the Clone Wars. Noted for his ruthlessness and extensive cybernetic enhancements, Grievous inspired fear as he traveled across the galaxy, invading entire worlds and engaging the Jedi Knights of the Republic.

A native of the planet Kalee, Grievous sustained severe injuries that required extensive repair by the time of the Clone Wars. Willingly submitting to a procedure that rendered him more mechanical than organic, he became a living weapon, granting him lightning-quick reflexes and devastating strength. Although he was neither Jedi or Sith, nor even sensitive to the power of the Force, Grievous was a skilled lightsaber duelist, having trained in the art of the lightsaber under the fallen Jedi Master-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku. Known for his hatred of the Jedi Order, Grievous killed Jedi over the course of the war, and would claim their lightsabers both as trophies and weapons to be used against other opponents, be they Jedi or clone troopers.

In addition to his combat skills, Grievous was a brilliant military strategist who oversaw multiple campaigns throughout the Clone Wars—from the Battle of Kamino, where he failed to halt the production line of clone troopers; to the Battle of Dathomir, where his battle droids massacred the Nightsisters led by the witch Mother Talzin. In 19 BBY, Grievous launched a daring raid on Coruscant, the Republic capital world, resulting in the abduction of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. However, the Jedi succeeded in rescuing the Chancellor while driving back the Separatist invaders. Following the loss of Dooku, Grievous and his army went into hiding in the Outer Rim Territories. Unknown to Grievous, his master, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, betrayed the general's location to the Jedi Order, allowing them to invade the planet Utapau in an effort to bring a swift and decisive conclusion to the war. As a result, Grievous was ultimately slain by his nemesis, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose 212th Attack Battalion went on to secure Utapau even as Order 66 went into effect, marking the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire."

During the war, he led a band of Wookiees to answer a distress signal made by Chewbacca, who was imprisoned on the Trandoshan hunting grounds of Wasskah. Tarfful later participated in the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside Chewbacca and Jedi Master Yoda. In the wake of Order 66 and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tarrful helped facilitate Yoda's escape and continued fighting against the tyranny of the Empire in the following years. At some point prior to the Great Jedi Purge, Tarfful met and befriended Jedi Master Eno Cordova, and helped him navigate Kashyyyk to learn about Zeffo culture. A male Wookiee native to his species's homeworld of Kashyyyk, Tarfful served as the chieftain of the coastal city Kachirho at the time of the Clone Wars. He also held the rank of general among his people. One standard year into the war, one of Tarfful's fellow Wookiees, Chewbacca, was captured by Trandoshans and taken to Wasskah to be hunted for sport. There, Chewbacca managed to build a device which sent a distress signal to Kashyyyk. Upon hearing of his friend's situation, Tarfful hired the bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas to transport him and a group of his most trusted warriors to Wasskah. Once there, the chieftain and his men made quick work of the Trandoshans and rescued Chewbacca, as well as Jedi younglings Ahsoka Tano, Jinx, and O-Mer. At one point, Tarfful was captured by Trandoshan slavers who had made a deal with Count Dooku, but he was rescued by a squad of clone commandos soon after. Tarfful took part in the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside Chewbacca and Jedi Generals Yoda, Luminara Unduli and Quinlan Vos. Aided by the Grand Army of the Republic, he led a local militia against the invading Separatist droid forces. Following the implementation of Order 66, Tarfful and Chewbacca helped Yoda elude the clone troopers and escape from the planet. In the wake of the Galactic Empire's rise, Tarrful's anti-Imperial stance made him a wanted criminal, forcing him to take shelter in the Shadowlands. In 14 BBY, Saw Gerrera's rebel cell, the Partisans, agreed to help Cal Kestis and the crew of the Stinger Mantis track down Tarfful, as the Wookiee chieftan was aware of information that could aid the Jedi Padawan in locating a Jedi holocron containing a list of names of several Force-sensitive children. After locating Tarfful in the Shadowlands, the majority of the Partisans evacuated Kashyyyk, whilst Wookiee Commander Choyyssyk and Partisan Mari Kosan remained with Tarfful. Tarfful later provided the information Kestis was seeking upon the Padawan's return to Kashyyyk."

Following Sidious' Declaration of a New Order, Moore became one of the first members of the Imperial Ruling Council and gained the sobriquet ""Queen of the Empire"" from the holomedia, with rumors spreading that she and the Emperor shared a relationship. She oversaw a series of experiments on Byss studying the spontaneous generation of life, which produced the future Imperial warlord Trioculus. Moore disappeared shortly into the Empire's reign, and was rumored to have died in seclusion in the Ghost Nebula after giving birth to Palpatine's biological son Triclops."
Tion Medon,206,80,none,grey,black,NA,male,Utapau,Pau'an,"Tion Medon was a male Pau'an and the Master of Port Administration of Utapau. A gaunt, gray-skinned humanoid, Tion Medon wore elaborate red robes and carried an ornate staff of office. He assisted Obi-Wan Kenobi during the late Clone Wars.
A member of the tall, thin Pau'an species, Tion Medon had an unsettling appearance to some, with glassy, sunken black eyes and a mouth of crooked teeth. However, appearances were deceptive, as Tion Medon was an accommodating, helpful being. As Port Administrator of his sinkhole sanctuary of Pau City, Tion welcomed guests, offering them his services.
Longevity came naturally to the Pau'ans, and Tion Medon had been Master of Port Administration for Pau City for more than 200-standard years by the time of the Clone Wars. Tion was a descendant of Timon Medon, who was credited with unifying Utapau. Like all Pau'ans, Tion preferred darkness to sunlight, and raw meat to cooked.
In the final weeks of the Clone Wars, Tion Medon was forced to accommodate General Grievous and his associates in his sanctuary. Grievous threatened to destroy Medon's city if he did not assist, or if he were to bring in aid from the Galactic Republic. Medon had no choice but to allow the Separatists to use his sanctuary as their base of operations.
Fortunately for the Administrator, help arrived of its own accord, in the form of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Despite General Grievous's threats, Tion Medon welcomed Kenobi to the spaceport, and discreetly divulged helpful information pertaining to the Separatist presence on Utapau. Kenobi, sent by the Jedi Council to track down General Grievous, was able to seek and destroy the Separatist Supreme Commander with Tion Medon's help."
Finn,178,73,black,dark,dark,NA,male,NA,Human,"Finn, formerly designated FN-2187 (""Eight-Seven""), was a Force-sensitive human male stormtrooper who served the First Order until his desertion and subsequent defection to the Resistance during the First Order–Resistance war. Though trained since birth to be a loyal and obedient soldier, FN-2187's conscience conflicted with the methods of the First Order. For a time he was unwilling to support the Resistance, hoping to escape the galactic conflict instead of fighting for a cause he believed was doomed to fail. As the galaxy became consumed by war, the renegade trooper was ultimately forced to decide where his true loyalties lay.

Born in 11 ABY during the New Republic Era, FN-2187 was part of a new generation of stormtroopers—human children conscripted into the military forces of the First Order—modeled on the Republic clone troopers and Imperial stormtroopers of the past. He originally trained with Batch Eight before joining the FN Corps, a sub-branch of the Stormtrooper Corps, and although his potential was recognized by his commanding officers, FN-2187 lacked the ruthlessness that had become common in the ranks under the influence of Captain Phasma. In the waning days of the Cold War, he hesitated to kill civilians during his first mission and consequently decided to desert after witnessing the massacre of Tuanul. Lacking experience as a pilot, FN-2187 freed a Resistance prisoner, Commander Poe Dameron, who coined the nickname ""Finn"" to supplant the renegade stormtrooper's alphanumeric designation. He then sought his own freedom while forming friendships with the Jakku scavenger Rey and the droid BB-8, as well as the Rebel war heroes Han Solo and Chewbacca.

After the destruction of the New Republic, Finn provided the Resistance with the information they needed to destroy the First Order's superweapon, Starkiller Base. During the attack, he was defeated and nearly killed by the dark warrior Kylo Ren. Rescued by Rey and Chewbacca, Finn recuperated from his injuries and by the time he awoke, the Resistance was forced to evacuate their base on D'Qar. Despite attempting to escape from the conflict once more, a mission with Rose Tico convinced Finn to truly join the Resistance to the extent where he nearly sacrificed his life for their cause during the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY. In 35 ABY, Finn continued assisting the Resistance by joining Rey on the quest to find the Sith wayfinder and destroy the malevolent religion once and for all, eventually becoming a general along with Poe after Leia's passing, with his first mission as a general being spent leading the ground forces during the Battle of Exegol."
Rey,170,54,brown,light,hazel,NA,female,NA,Human,"Rey Skywalker, once known only as Rey, was a human female Jedi Master who fought on the side of the Resistance in the war against the First Order. A former scavenger from the planet Jakku, her life was changed by the tumultuous events of the last days of the New Republic Era. Her decision to help the droid BB-8 would set Rey on a course to discovering the Force that awakened within her, leading her to seek out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker for training. Yet despite her commitment to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force, Rey felt the pull to the dark side due to her anger and the adversarial relationship she had with Ben Solo, a fallen Jedi whom she knew as the dark warrior Kylo Ren. The unique Force-bond between them was a result of their nature as a dyad in the Force.

Rey was born in 15 ABY during the rise of the New Republic. Her father was a bioengineered Strand-Cast cloned from the genetic template of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who ruled the Galactic Empire as Emperor Palpatine. The clone and Rey's mother chose to live as simple junk traders in order to hide their daughter, who inherited Sidious' connection to the Force, from his followers. After the deaths of her parents, Rey was forced to survive on her own in the Jakku desert, and became a skilled mechanic, pilot and combatant in the process. Her isolated life was disrupted shortly before war broke out across the galaxy in 34 ABY. Determined to help the Resistance, Rey gained several new allies including Finn, a renegade stormtrooper, as well as the veterans Han Solo and Chewbacca. In the course of their journey, she discovered her latent Force powers and sought guidance under Skywalker, who taught her the art of the Force despite his decision to end the Jedi legacy. After Skywalker sacrificed himself to save the Resistance, Rey assumed his mantle as the last Jedi and became the apprentice of General Leia Organa.

With the return of Darth Sidious in 35 ABY, Rey set out to find the dark world of Exegol and prevent the Sith from being reborn. It was through Kylo Ren that Rey discovered her origins as the Dark Lord's granddaughter, and upon confronting Sidious in person, she was nearly swayed to the dark side of the Force. However, Rey was saved by Ben Solo after he renounced his dark alter ego. Aided by the spirits of all the Jedi, Rey died vanquishing her grandfather, causing Solo to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to bring Rey back to life. The two embraced and shared a kiss as Solo peacefully vanished in Rey's arms. Although Solo was the last of the Skywalker bloodline, Rey assumed the name ""Skywalker"" to honor their memory, repudiating her own heritage as a Palpatine."
Poe Dameron,NA,NA,brown,light,brown,NA,male,NA,Human,"Poe Dameron was a human male who originally served as a member of the Spice Runners of Kijimi, before becoming a pilot in the New Republic and eventually joining the Resistance, rising to become acting General of the Resistance, during its conflict and subsequent war with the First Order. The son of Lieutenant Shara Bey and Sergeant Kes Dameron of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps in becoming a pilot, serving the New Republic Defense Fleet as the commander of Rapier Squadron, but grew disillusioned with the Republic's inaction to the First Order's violations of the Galactic Concordance. Dameron defected to the Resistance, where he became one of General Leia Organa's most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the callsign of Black Leader while piloting his specialized T-70 X-wing starfighter, Black One.

As the conflict with the First Order grew more desperate, Dameron was sent to find Lor San Tekka on Jakku, who had part of a map to locate Organa's brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Though Dameron entrusted the map to his astromech droid BB-8, he was captured by the First Order and interrogated for the location of the map, eventually being forced to hand over the information. He escaped with the help of a defecting stormtrooper, whom Dameron nicknamed Finn, and returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar on his own. He aided Finn, Rey, Han Solo, and Chewbacca with air support during the Battle of Takodana, and he later flew during the battle to destroy the superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, after the base was damaged by Solo, Finn, Rey, and Chewbacca, Dameron fired the shots that destroyed the Starkiller weapon, saving the Resistance from certain destruction.

During the subsequent battle of D'Qar, Dameron disobeyed orders and led an attack on the First Order Dreadnought Fulminatrix, but his reckless actions caused him to be demoted from Wing Commander to captain. As the First Order pursued the Resistance by tracking them through hyperspace to the Crait system, Dameron did not approve of the passive strategy of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo and worked with Finn and mechanic Rose Tico to break into Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, and disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker before eventually staging a mutiny against Admiral Holdo in an effort to buy Finn and Rose time.

However, Dameron and the mutineers had not realized that Holdo's plan was to discreetly transport the Resistance to an abandoned Rebel base on the nearby planet Crait, and his group's actions caused the First Order to discover the Resistance's escape vessels and destroy many of them. Even so, General Organa gave Dameron command after Holdo sacrificed herself, and he led a last-ditch counterattack against the First Order during the Battle of Crait. The counterattack was unsuccessful, but Dameron was able to lead the surviving Resistance fighters while a Force projection of Luke Skywalker distracted Kylo Ren and the First Order, where they found their way to Rey and the Millennium Falcon, allowing them to escape.

After the escape, the group took the brief moment of peace to catch up on recent events, and as he left for the Battle of Grail City, the ace was promoted back to commander. After that, he reflected on what it truly meant to be a member of the Resistance, and how he believed it was about bringing light to dark and saving one's galaxy."
BB8,NA,NA,none,none,black,NA,none,NA,Droid,"BB-8, sometimes spelled and pronounced Beebee-Ate and nicknamed BB, was a BB-series astromech droid who operated approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. It had a dome head, similar to that of R2 series astromech droids, with the bulk of its body made up of a ball on which the droid's head rolled. BB-8 was mostly white, with some silver and orange on its body, as well as a black photoreceptor. The droid belonged to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whom he accompanied during his flights on his T-70 X-wing starfighter."
Captain Phasma,200,76,gold,light,blue,NA,female,NA,NA,"Phasma was a human female stormtrooper captain of the First Order. Phasma grew up as a member of the Scyre clan on the nuclear-ravaged world of Parnassos. She was a formidable warrior who became the clan's military leader. Seeking passage offworld, Phasma helped the First Order General Brendol Hux find his ship in the process betraying her own brother Keldo and clan. After being rescued, Phasma joined the First Order, abandoning her former life on Parnassos.

Over the years, Phasma rose through the ranks of the First Order and became in charge of their stormtrooper training program. She conspired with Brendol's son General Armitage Hux to assassinate her former benefactor. Phasma also survived an assassination attempt by Brendol's former protege Cardinal, who sought revenge for Brendol's death. Having consolidated her position within the First Order, Phasma became part of an unofficial triumvirate consisting of General Hux and the dark enforcer Kylo Ren.

As a senior officer, Phasma commanded First Order forces in their struggle against the Resistance. Under orders from the Supreme Leader of the First Order, Snoke, the triumvirate searched for a galaxy map that would lead to the last of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker, on the planet Jakku. Phasma participated in a massacre at Tuanul village, an atrocity which led the stormtrooper FN-2187 to defect to the Resistance.

Following the Hosnian Cataclysm, Phasma was ambushed by FN-2187, now with the Resistance as Finn, who had infiltrated Starkiller Base with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. Surviving the Battle of Starkiller Base, Phasma framed Lieutenant Sol Rivas for the base's destruction and led a mission to hunt down the fugitive in order to conceal her own malfeasance. During the pursuit of the Resistance fleet, Phasma fought with the infiltrator Finn aboard the First Order flagship Supremacy, which had recently been devastated by a hyperspace ramming attack that freed the former stormtrooper. Phasma was defeated by the combined efforts of Finn and his new companion, Rose Tico. Subsequently, the captain fell to her death into a fire that was consuming the stricken ship."
Padmé Amidala,165,45,brown,light,brown,46BBY,female,Naboo,Human,"Padmé Amidala, also known as Padmé Amidala Naberrie, was a human female senator who represented the people of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Prior to her career in the Galactic Senate, Amidala was the elected ruler of the Royal House of Naboo. A political idealist, she advocated for the preservation of democracy as well as a peaceful resolution to the Clone Wars. However, her secret marriage to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would have a lasting effect on the future of the galaxy for decades to come.

Born in 46 BBY during the Age of the Republic, Padmé Naberrie was raised by her parents, Ruwee Naberrie and his wife Jobal, on the peaceful Mid Rim world of Naboo. Despite the humble background of the Naberrie family, Padmé was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to civic duty, she was elected queen and, therefore, adopted the regnal name ""Amidala"" in 32 BBY. Due to the machinations of her advisor, Senator Sheev Palpatine, Amidala's reign was put to the test by the Trade Federation's blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Unable to fight the Federation's army of battle droids without assistance, the queen beseeched the Galactic Senate on Coruscant for help, only to see her efforts hampered by bureaucracy and procedure. Although she ultimately liberated her homeworld with the help of the Jedi Order and the Gungan Grand Army, her decision to cast a Vote of No Confidence against Finis Valorum enabled Palpatine to become the Supreme Chancellor.

Following her reign, Amidala joined the Senate and struggled to resolve the Separatist Crisis through diplomacy, becoming a leading voice in the Loyalist Committee by 22 BBY. After surviving an assassination attempt, she was removed from the capital and sent back to Naboo under the protection of Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Though the Jedi Code forbade personal relationships, deeming attachment, and possession unbecoming of a Jedi, the two gradually became closer as their feelings for each other grew. In the aftermath of the First Battle of Geonosis, Amidala secretly married her Jedi protector, despite her own reservations about their relationship and the consequences they would face if the truth ever came to light. Their subsequent interactions were limited throughout the Clone Wars, with Amidala continuing to advocate peaceful solutions in the Senate while Skywalker served on the front lines as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. In the waning months of the pan-galactic conflict, Amidala revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. As a result of Skywalker's fear of loss, he was seduced by the dark side of the Force, believing that by becoming a Sith Lord he would gain the power to prevent his wife from dying in childbirth. Amidala, who learned of her husband's transformation into a Sith, ultimately died of a broken heart after giving birth to the twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Amidala Skywalker. With her dying breath, she claimed that there was still good in the former Anakin Skywalker, who embraced the persona of Darth Vader throughout the reign of the Galactic Empire.

Amidala's children played a major role in the fragmentation of the Empire and the redemption of her husband. Like her mother, Leia entered public service and became a flag-bearer for the democratic ideals of liberty and justice as a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and its successor, the New Republic, before becoming the founding general of the Resistance against the First Order—a successor state to the Galactic Empire. Luke, on the other hand, was trained in the ways of the Jedi like his father before him and was a celebrated war hero of the Rebel Alliance. Through Luke's efforts to redeem his father back to the light, Amidala's last words proved true when Anakin killed the Emperor during the Battle of Endor."
Din Djarin,NA,NA,dark brown ,tan,brown,19BBY,male,,Human,"Din Djarin, commonly known as ""the Mandalorian"" or ""Mando"" for short, was a human male Mandalorian who worked as a bounty hunter during the New Republic Era. With his Mandalorian armor and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmatic—a stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others. Orphaned during the Republic Era and raised as a foundling, he was trained to become a Mandalorian warrior and eventually joined the Tribe, who operated on Nevarro. Djarin became battle-hardened, a man of few words, and a formidable hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy.

After the fall of the Galactic Empire, Djarin made a reputation for himself as a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, collecting bounties as he traveled across the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories—far from the authority of the New Republic—in his personal starship, the Razor Crest. Around 9 ABY, Djarin was hired on Nevarro by a client of an Imperial remnant faction, who offered a substantial reward for the acquisition of an asset located on the world Arvala-7. During his mission on Arvala-7, he met an Ugnaught named Kuiil, who guided him to the location of the asset. On his way to the asset, Djarin encountered a droid bounty hunter, IG-11, and the two entered the building in the encampment guarded by mercenaries where the asset was kept. Upon seeing the asset itself, they discovered that it was in fact a Force-sensitive child who belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda. Djarin, who was tasked with bringing the Child alive, shot IG-11, who was about to kill the Child, and saved the infant, taking him into his custody.

Discovering the Child's Force-sensitivity during his time on Arvala-7, Djarin then took the Child back to the Client and collected his reward. However, the Mandalorian warrior had already begun to form a bond with the infant. Feeling remorseful for subjecting the Child to a cruel fate, Djarin entered the facility where the Child was kept and rescued him from the Imperials stationed there, and later fended off Guild hunters with the help of the Tribe. The two would go on to embark on various adventures around the galaxy as they formed a close bond, including an encounter with former rebel shock trooper Carasynthia Dune, a job on Tatooine, and a run-in with a group of mercenaries.

Djarin was later contacted by the Guild's agent, Greef Karga, who wished to make amends for his actions during the Child's rescue. The Guild agent offered to work with the Mandalorian to drive away the Imperials, who took control over Nevarro's city, in exchange for dropping the bounty on the Child. Djarin then gathered his allies—Dune, Kuiil, and a re-programmed IG-11—and met with Karga on Nevarro. Djarin and his allies entered the city and fought the Imperials led by Moff Gideon, later retreating to the Tribe's covert after facing heavy opposition. The Mandalorian known as ""The Armorer,"" who had remained in the hideout after the covert's attempted relocation, tasked Djarin with returning the Child to his people, and declared the creation of his clan. After dealing with Gideon and his remaining Imperials, Djarin departed the planet with the infant and began his search for the Child's people."
The Child,NA,NA,white,green,brown,41BBY,male,NA,Yoda's species,"""The Child"" was a male Force-sensitive Mandalorian foundling that belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Yaddle. The Child was born around 41 BBY, and was held at an encampment run by Nikto mercenaries on Arvala-7 during the New Republic Era. While still an infant at the age of fifty years old, he was sought by an Imperial who hired a Mandalorian bounty hunter named Din Djarin to retrieve him.

However, Djarin chose not to leave the Child with the Imperials and saved him from the Imperial remnant facility. After attempting to hide with the Child along the fringes of the galaxy, Djarin returned to Nevarro to deal with the Imperials chasing the Child in hopes of keeping him safe. In the process, the Child became a Mandalorian foundling and the single other member of Djarin's newly created clan."
