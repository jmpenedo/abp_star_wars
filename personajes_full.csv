Luke Skywalker,blue,male,Human,"Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo, Skywalker served on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republican organization committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.
The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first apprentice was Luke's own father. During the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY, Skywalker saved the Alliance from annihilation by destroying the Empire's planet-killing superweapon, the Death Star. He continued his training in the years that followed, determined to become a Jedi Knight like his father before him, and found a new mentor in Grand Master Yoda. After his master's death, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, during which he confronted the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he learned was in fact his father, Anakin Skywalker. With Luke's help, Anakin returned to the light side of the Force by killing Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious at the cost of his own life, fulfilling his destiny as the Chosen One.
With the Sith's destruction and the subsequent capitulation of the Empire in 5 ABY, Luke Skywalker traveled across the galaxy, searching for knowledge that would aid him in rebuilding the Jedi Order. One of his apprentices was his sister's son, Ben Solo, who inherited the Skywalker bloodline's raw strength and potential for limitless power. The loss of his nephew, who fell to the dark side like Vader before him, haunted Skywalker for the rest of his life. In addition, the destruction of his nascent Order convinced him that the time had come for the Jedi to end. He therefore sought exile on the distant world of Ahch-To, having elected to live out his remaining days as a hermit despite the galaxy's pleas for help during the rise of the First Order. His solitude was interrupted in 34 ABY, shortly after the fall of the New Republic, resulting in a chain of events that led Skywalker to play one last, momentous role in the conflict between light and darkness. Although he passed away into the Force, his legend would spread throughout the galaxy, rekindling a spark of hope in the enemies of the First Order. Before his death, Skywalker declared that the Jedi Order would not die with him, having trained a final apprentice: the Jakku scavenger known as Rey.
In 35 ABY, Skywalker's spirit communed with Rey during the final days of the war. The Jedi apprentice had exiled herself to Ahch-To, following in Skywalker's example. However, Skywalker urged Rey to confront her grandfather, the resurrected Darth Sidious. Believing he had been wrong, Skywalker told Rey that a Jedi's destiny was to confront fear. Following the Emperor's destruction, the spirits of Skywalker and his sister were watching over Rey when she took their family name as her own."
C-3PO,yellow,,Droid,"C-3PO, sometimes spelled See-Threepio and often referred to simply as Threepio, was a 3PO-series protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. He was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.
C-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker, a human slave who lived in Mos Espa, a city on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. C-3PO and R2-D2 were assigned to the Alderaan cruiser Tantive IV, where they served senator Bail Organa for nineteen years. At some point during this time, 3PO's right leg was fitted with mismatched plating.
They became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. After meeting Skywalker's son, Luke and the smuggler Han Solo, the droids helped rescue princess Leia from the Empire's Death Star. They became directly attached to the three humans, helping them and their rebellion defeat the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy, most notably when he convinced the Ewoks to aid the Rebels at the Battle of Endor.
Following the Battle of Endor, C-3PO continued serving the Skywalkers and Han Solo during the time of the New Republic. About thirty years after the events on Endor, C-3PO was still an aide to Leia Organa, who had become a General in the Resistance, a private military group opposed to the First Order, a military junta that emulated the Old Empire. By that time, C-3PO's language database had been updated so that he could understand and communicate in over seven million different forms of communication, including ancient Sith dialects."
R2-D2,red,,Droid,"R2-D2, pronounced Artoo-Deetoo and often referred to as R2 (Artoo), was an R2-series astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton with masculine programming. A smart, spunky droid who would serve a multitude of masters over his lifetime, R2-D2 was never given a full memory wipe (apart from a partial wipe of select information by Cad Bane during the senate hostage crisis) nor did he ever receive new programming, with these factors resulting in an adventurous and independent attitude. Often finding himself in pivotal moments in galactic history, his bravery and ingenuity saved the galaxy on numerous occasions.
Beginning his service in the employ of Queen Amidala of Naboo, R2-D2 wound up serving Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, often accompanied by the protocol droid C-3PO in many adventures throughout the Clone Wars. After Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force, the droid served Senator Bail Organa for a time in the Imperial Senate. Nineteen years following the purge of the Galactic Republic, R2-D2 played a pivotal role in helping the Rebel Alliance destroy the Empire's Death Star superweapon. He carried technical readouts vital to its destruction. Serving Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, the son of his two former masters throughout the Galactic Civil War, he participated in both the Battles of Hoth and Endor, and witnessed the successful destruction of the Empire's second Death Star four years after the first one was demolished.
In the subsequent thirty years, R2 accompanied Luke Skywalker until the undoing of his attempted resurrection of the Jedi Order in 28 ABY. Following Luke's disappearance, R2 entered a self-imposed low power mode as newer droid models started to out-compute the aging astromech. Despite this, his celebrated role in the Rebellion protected him from the usual recycling procedure of many old droids, allowing him a semi-retirement in the Resistance as he pored over several decades of uninterrupted data, and ""dreamed"" of his greatest adventures."
Darth Vader,yellow,male,Human,"Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive Human male who served the Galactic Republic as a Jedi Knight and later served the Galactic Empire as the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Born to the slave Shmi Skywalker in 41.9 BBY, Anakin was conceived by midi-chlorians, the symbiotic organisms that allowed individuals to touch the Force, and he and his mother were brought to the desert planet of Tatooine to be the slaves of Gardulla the Hutt. They soon ended up as the property of the Toydarian Watto, and Skywalker exhibited exceptional piloting skills and a reputation for being able to build and repair anything even at a young age. In 32 BBY, Skywalker encountered the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and Padmé Amidala, and he helped them secure the parts they needed for their starship by winning the Boonta Eve Classic podracing eventonly to learn that he had also won his freedom in doing so.

Reluctantly leaving his mother behind, Skywalker accompanied Jinn and his group to the Republic's capital of Coruscant and participated in the Battle of Naboo, helping to free Amidala's homeworld from the armies of the Trade Federation. While Jinn was killed during the battle, Jinn's student Obi-Wan Kenobi followed Jinn's wishes and took on Skywalker as his Padawan, and much of the Jedi Council believed that Skywalker was the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy: one who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith Order. Skywalker and Kenobi had a number of adventures during the Padawan's decade of training to become a Jedi, but as the Separatist Crisis threatened to tear the Republic apart in 22 BBY, Skywalker was reunited with Amidala when he was assigned to protect her from assassins. The two grew close during the course of the assignment, though they were caught up in the Battle of Geonosis and the beginning of the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Losing an arm during the fighting, Skywalker received a cybernetic replacement, and he and Amidala were secretly married in the days after the battle, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions on romantic attachments.

During the Clone Wars, which raged for the next three years, Skywalker was granted the rank of Jedi Knight and became known to the public as the ""Hero with No Fear."" Taking on the Togruta Ahsoka Tano as his apprentice, Skywalker fought alongside Kenobi and his fellow Jedi in scores of battles, and his friendship with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine deepened despite the Jedi Order's wariness of Palpatine's rapid acquisition of further powers during the course of the war. Throughout the Clone Wars, Skywalker's anger and sense of loss pushed him ever closer to the dark side of the Force, and his visions of Amidala dying in childbirth in 19 BBY made him desperate to find a way to save his wife. Palpatine, who was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, manipulated Skywalker into becoming his apprentice with the promise of saving Amidala, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader as Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and eradicated the Jedi Order.

Vader and Kenobi clashed on Mustafar after Vader attacked his wife in the belief that she had betrayed him, and the newly christened Sith Lord was left limbless and ravaged by fire at the end of their battle. Encased in a suit of life-sustaining black armor and believing his wife to be dead, Vader embraced his role as the Emperor's right hand and enforcer, hunting down Jedi survivors and enforcing the will of the Empire for years to come. The Sith Lord trained a number of secret apprentices and Dark Jedi, though his plans to overthrow his master had not advanced far when the Galactic Civil War erupted between the Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic in 2 BBY. In 0 BBY, the Death Starthe Empire's greatest superweaponwas destroyed by a young Rebel pilot despite Vader's efforts, and Vader became obsessed with discovering the pilot's identity, only to learn that it was Luke Skywalker: his own son, born before Amidala's death.

Vader continued to pursue both Skywalker and the Alliance over the next three years, finally luring his son into a trap on the mining colony of Cloud City in 3 ABY where the two dueled. Vader revealed his identity to Skywalker, though his son refused to join him and escaped. When Darth Sidious learned of Skywalker's existence, he set in motion his own plans to recruit Skywalker and thereby replace Vader, but Skywalker surrendered himself to Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor in 4 ABY in hopes of redeeming his father and turning him back to the light side. In a final duel on the second Death Star as the Battle of Endor raged around them, Skywalker and Vader fought each other, and Vader refused his son's attempts to redeem him, learning that Skywalker had a twin sister named Leia in the process. Skywalker defeated his father but refused to kill him, and when Sidious attempted to kill the young man, Vadermoved by his son's loveabandoned the dark side and sacrificed himself to destroy the Emperor, fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Mortally wounded, Anakin made peace with his son and became one with the Force, though his reputation, his legacy, and his family endured for decades afterwards."
Leia Organa,brown,female,Human,"Leia Skywalker Organa Solo was a Force-sensitive human female political and military leader who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Imperial Era and the New Republic and Resistance in the subsequent New Republic Era. Adopted into the House of Organa, the Alderaanian royal family, she was Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, a planet in the Core Worlds known for its dedication to pacifism. The princess was raised as the daughter of Senator Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, making her the heir to the Alderaanian monarchy. Instilled with the values of her adopted homeworld, Organa devoted her life to the restoration of democracy by opposing authoritarian regimes such as the Galactic Empire and the First Order.
Born in 19 BBY as Leia Amidala Skywalker, she was the biological offspring of the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. Her birth occurred in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, which saw the Jedi Order purged and the Galactic Republic reorganized into the Galactic Empire. With her mother's death in childbirth and her father's fall to the dark side of the Force, Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker were separated to keep them hidden from the Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. As the adopted daughter of a politician, Leia Organa eventually succeeded Bail by representing their homeworld in the Imperial Senate, though secretly she supported the Rebellion. During the Galactic Civil War, however, Alderaan was destroyed along with its inhabitants and the royal family by the Empire's DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station, causing Organa to openly fight the New Order as a leader of the Rebel Alliance.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Endor, Organa married the Corellian smuggler Han Solo and learned the Jedi arts as her brother's apprentice until giving birth to her son, Ben Solo, on the day of the Empire's capitulation in 5 ABY. Her personal and political life suffered in the years that followed, with Ben turning to the dark side like his grandfather before him, adopting the persona of Kylo Ren, and the Galactic Senate sidelining Organa's career. Adopting the military rank of general, she led the Resistance during the Cold War and sought to make amends with Ben. Despite her efforts, the First Order succeeded in destroying the New Republic, and Organa's husband died at the hand of their estranged son in 34 ABY. Organa continued to lead the Resistance during the war against the First Order, all the while training Reya Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakkuas a Jedi.
As her health declined, Organa used her remaining strength to reach her son, calling him back to the light side of the Force. Following her death on Ajan Kloss in 35 ABY, the Resistance defeated the forces of the reborn Darth Sidious's Sith Eternal on Exegol, and inspired an uprising against the First Order across the galaxy. The heir to three inheritances, Leia Skywalker Organa Solo's legacy passed on to the Jedi Rey Skywalker, the military leader Poe Dameron of the Resistance, and Ben Solo, her only son, who ultimately returned to the light and sacrificed himself for Rey."
Owen Lars,blue,male,Human,"Owen Lars was a human male moisture farmer from the desert planet Tatooine. He was the son of Aika and Cliegg Lars, and he became the stepbrother of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker when Cliegg married Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker. In 22 BBY, Shmi was killed by Tusken Raiders, and Cliegg passed away soon after. Lars married his girlfriend, Beru Whitesun, and they toiled to maintain the homestead.
In 19 BBY, Lars and his wife were contacted by Skywalker's Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and they were tasked with caring for Skywalker's infant son, Luke. Lars believed that Skywalker had died due to his role as a Jedi, so to protect Luke, the farmer forbade Kenobi from visiting or training the boy. In the following years, Lars prevented Luke from knowing the truth about his father, and he kept the boy busy with farm work.
In 0 BBY, Lars and Luke Skywalker purchased the droid R2-D2, who, unbeknownst to them, possessed stolen plans for the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon. Imperial stormtroopers tracked the droid to Lars' homestead, where they interrogated and murdered both him and his wife. When Skywalker discovered that his family had been killed, he left Tatooine with Kenobi to train as a Jedi, joining the Rebel Alliance and destroying the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin."
Beru Whitesun lars,blue,female,Human,"Beru Whitesun Lars, born Beru Whitesun, was a human female from the planet Tatooine. She was married to Owen Lars, the stepbrother of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, whose son, Luke Skywalker, they raised during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Lars was killed along with her husband by Imperial stormtroopers, who also burned down the Lars moisture farm. With their deaths, Skywalker left his homeworld and joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic."
R5-D4,red,,Droid,"R5-D4, also called ""Red"" by Luke Skywalker, was a red and white-striped R5 astromech droid owned by a group of Jawas on Tatooine in the early days of the Galactic Civil War. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Jawas attempted to sell him to Owen Lars, but the droid purposely malfunctioned his motivator at the advice of R2-D2, so that Lars could purchase R2-D2 in R5-D4's place. The droid survived an Imperial attack on the sandcrawler soon after, and went out to find the rebellion. R5 was still active by the time of the New Republic Era, and eventually came into the service of Peli Motto. He projected a map of Tatooine in order to assist the Mandalorian Din Djarin."
Biggs Darklighter,brown,male,Human,"Biggs Darklighter was a human male ace pilot who fought for the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the early days of the Galactic Civil War. He grew up on the desert world of Tatooine, where he became a close boyhood friend of Luke Skywalker. The two became pilots and dreamed of leaving Tatooine. Darklighter left his homeworld for the Imperial Academy, but defected from the Galactic Empire after graduation in order to join the Rebel Alliance. He returned to Tatooine one final time to tell Skywalker of his plans.
With his home planet behind him, Darklighter relocated to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. He reunited with Skywalker, who had helped rescue Princess Leia Organa, a leader in the Alliance, from the Death Star with stolen plans for the planet-destroying space station. The Rebellion analyzed the plans and organized the Battle of Yavin, where Darklighter and Skywalker flew as members of Red Squadron in the assault on the station. Skywalker successfully destroyed the Death Star, but not before Darklighter was killed in combat by Darth Vader."
Obi-Wan Kenobi,blue-gray,male,Human,"Obi-Wan Kenobi was a legendary human male Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Republic Era. During the Imperial Era, he adopted the alias Ben Kenobi in order to hide from the regime that drove the Jedi to near extinction. A noble man known for his skills with the Force, Kenobi trained Anakin Skywalker, served as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic, and became a mentor to Luke Skywalker prior to his death in 0 BBY.
Born on the planet Stewjon in 57 BBY, Kenobi joined the Jedi Orderan order of Force-sensitive peacekeepersat a young age. Following his initial lessons under Grand Master Yoda, he became the Padawan of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Kenobi defeated the Sith Lord Darth Maul and was awarded the status of Jedi Knight. As a result of Jinn's death, Kenobi took on the task of training Anakin Skywalker, but often had to rein in his adventure-seeking apprentice. Although he deemed Skywalker arrogant and overconfident in his Force powers, Kenobi also regarded him as a brother and good friend. Moreover, he was convinced that Skywalker was the Chosen One destined to bring the Force into balance by destroying the Sith.
In the aftermath of the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, Kenobi and his fellow Jedi defended the Galactic Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, becoming generals in the Republic Military. As the commanding officer of the 7th Sky Corps, Kenobi's second-in-command was Clone Marshal Commander CC-2224 ""Cody,"" although he also often served with Skywalker who commanded the elite 501st Legion. In 19 BBY, Kenobi destroyed General Grievous, effectively ending the Clone Wars. By then, however, Order 66 was activated by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, which resulted in the clone troopers turning against their Jedi officers. Kenobi survived Cody's betrayal, only to discover that Skywalker turned to the dark side of the Force as Darth Vader. A fateful battle ensued between the former friends, and ended with Kenobi leaving Vader to die on Mustafar. With the Jedi all but extinct, Kenobi exiled himself to Tatooine where he lived as a hermit for two decades.
During the Galactic Civil War, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan was captured by the Galactic Empire while attempting to recruit Kenobi for the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Kenobi chose to answer the Alliance's plea for help, and also began training Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, who sought to become a Jedi like his father before him. Their time together was cut short, however, as Kenobi sacrificed himself to protect Skywalker. Vader struck down his former master, but ultimately death was not the end for Kenobi, having preserved his consciousness as a Force spirit. He would continue to watch over Skywalker, guiding him on his path to knighthood."
Anakin Skywalker,blue,male,Human,"Anakin Skywalker was a human male Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic and the Chosen One of the Force. During the Clone Wars, his accomplishments as a Jedi General earned him the Hero With No Fear moniker. After turning to the dark side of the Force, he became known as Darth Vader, a Dark Lord of the Sith and Sith apprentice to Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. As a Sith Lord, Vader turned against his former comrades and hunted the surviving Jedi into near extinction. He became an enforcer of the Galactic Empire, and worked to crush the Alliance to Restore the Republic for opposing his Sith Master's will. Yet despite his actions as Darth Vader, a glimmer of the light side of the Force remained within the former Anakin Skywalker.
Skywalker was born in the year 41 BBY on the Outer Rim planet Tatooine during the Age of the Republic. Although he had a mother, the slave Shmi Skywalker, the truth about his parentage was that Anakin had no fatherleading Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn to suspect that Skywalker's conception was the work of the midi-chlorians. Recognizing the child's unprecedented connection to the Force, Jinn was determined to see Skywalker trained as a member of the Jedi Order, the task of which ultimately fell to his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi following Jinn's death by Darth Maul in 32 BBY.
Over the next decade, Skywalker rose to become one of the strongest Jedi in galactic history. While he was both caring and compassionate, his fear of loss was ultimately the catalyst for his downfall. During the Clone Wars, Skywalker trained a Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, who ultimately left the Jedi Order after she was framed for the terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple. The loss of Tano affected Skywalker on a personal level, causing him to feel more isolated and bitter towards the Jedi High Council. With the Clone Wars nearing conclusion, Skywalker succumbed to the temptations of the dark side, believing the Sith had the power to save the life of Senator Padmé Amidala, his secret wife. Christened ""Darth Vader"" by his new Master Darth Sidious, the newly minted Sith Lord assaulted the Coruscant Jedi Temple, killing fully trained Jedi and novice younglings alike.
After assassinating the leaders of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Vader was confronted on Mustafar by his former friend and mentor, Kenobi, resulting in a lightsaber duel that left Vader badly burned and mutilated. As a consequence of his defeat, he was rebuilt as a cyborg and encased in a life-sustaining suit of armor, further distancing the persona of Vader from that of Skywalker. In addition, Amidala's death in childbirth broke the fallen Jedi Knight's heart, leaving him more machine than man mentally as well as physically.
Throughout the Dark Times, the former Anakin Skywalker brought fear to the galaxy in his capacity as the Emperor's dark enforcer. However, in spite of his deep immersion in darkness, Vader never succeeded in fully killing the side of himself that was Skywalker. His confrontation with his son, the aspiring Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, during the Galactic Civil War awoke the compassion within the Sith Lord, causing Vader to renounce his allegiance to the Sith in order to save Luke from the Emperor's wrath. By killing his master, however, Vader sustained critical damage to his armor, making death inevitable. Resigned to his fate, his dying wish was to see his son with his own eyes for the first and final time. In the end, he died not as Darth Vader but as Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One who brought balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. His destiny fulfilled, Skywalker's consciousness was able to endure beyond death due to his sacrifice and redemption, allowing him to live on in spirit alongside his deceased Jedi mentors, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda.
Decades after the Battle of Endor, Anakin's footsteps were followed in by Ben Solo, his grandson by Princess Leia Organa, Skywalker's daughter, and the smuggler Han Solo. Ben fell to the dark side and took the identity of Kylo Ren under the influence of Supreme Leader Snoke, believing it was his destiny to complete Vader's legacy and annihilate the Jedi Order. However, Ren was ultimately redeemed. Becoming Ben Solo again, he sacrificed himself to save Rey after she died destroying the resurrected Darth Sidious with the help of the spirits of the past Jedi, including Anakin. Thus, the Sith's rebirth was prevented and balance was preserved."
Wilhuff Tarkin,blue,male,Human,"Wilhuff Tarkin was a human male politician, bureaucrat, and military officer whose career spanned the Fall of the Republic and the Age of the Empire. Born on the planet Eriadu in 64 BBY, he was a member of the Tarkin family and the great-nephew of Jova Tarkin. During the Republic Era, Tarkin served in the Galactic Republic's Judicial Department for a time before returning to his homeworld as the Governor of Eriadu. When the Clone Wars began, he renewed his military service, becoming a commissioned officer in the Republic Navy.
As a captain, Tarkin served under Jedi General Even Piell until the latter's death on Lola Sayu, where the two were held as prisoners in the Citadel by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Saved by a Jedi-led rescue team, Tarkin grew to respect the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who agreed with the captain's belief that the Jedi Code conflicted with their wartime duties. He staunchly opposed the Jedi Order's role as leaders in the Grand Army of the Republic, believing that peacekeepers should not direct the Republic war effort. A favorite of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, Tarkin served on the Strategic Advisory Cell and was promoted to the military rank of Admiral. When Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, it was Tarkin who acted as the prosecutor in her trial.
Tarkin continued to rise in power with the proclamation of a new regime, the Galactic Empire, ruled by the self-appointed Emperor Palpatine. Joining the ranks of the New Order's regional governors, Grand Moff Tarkin administrated the Outer Rim Territories and was also involved in the secret construction of the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station. As governor of the regions of space along the galactic frontier, he sought to enforce Imperial rule on restive worlds such as Lothal where rebel cells grew increasingly bold in their opposition to the Empire. Having retained Palpatine's favor in the New Order, Tarkin often worked alongside the Emperor's chief enforcer, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, whom he once knew as Skywalker.
A proponent of the doctrine of fear, he believed that the battle station and its planet-killing superweapon would terrify the galaxy into total submission. At Tarkin's command the Core World Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star, instantly killing billions of Alderaanians. Tarkin ultimately perished, however, when the Alliance to Restore the Republic succeeded in destroying the station at the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. As a result, his memory was tarnished in the views of some Imperial officers, such as Grand General Cassio Tagge, who referred to the Death Star as ""Tarkin's folly."" Princess Leia Organa remembered Tarkin as the man who destroyed her adopted homeworld and family long after his death. The First Order, having risen to power as the Empire's successor opposing the New Republic, commemorated Tarkin's memory in an effort to portray Imperial leaders in a more heroic light."
Chewbacca,blue,male,Wookiee,"Chewbacca, known affectionately to his friends as Chewie, was a Wookiee male warrior, smuggler, mechanic, pilot, and resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, and the conflict and subsequent war between the First Order and the Resistance. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi Master Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee Tarfful, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.
In the years that followed, during the rule of the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca was enslaved by the Empire until he was rescued by Captain Han Solo and became his co-pilot aboard the Millennium Falcon. Together, they assisted Tobias Beckett and Qi'ra in a coaxium run for Crimson Dawn. They later worked in the employ of crime lord Jabba the Hutt until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to ferry him, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to Alderaan on a mission vital to the survival of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After finding Alderaan was destroyed, the group was brought aboard the Death Star, where they helped Princess Leia Organa escape from captivity and return to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the Battle of Yavin and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.
Throughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an assault on Cymoon 1 and the battle on Vrogas Vas. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from Echo Base on the planet Hoth after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with Lando Calrissian, an old friend of Solo's, on Cloud City, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to Darth Vader, the Emperor's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was frozen in carbonite and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, where Chewbacca and his friends saved Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the Battle of Endor, where Chewbacca helped destroy the shield generator and allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. The Emperor was killed for the first time aboard the battle station, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.
After Endor and the rise of the New Republic, Chewbacca and Solo fought to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his family. After Solo's son Ben, turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the Millennium Falcon and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the Eravana, but they eventually found the Falcon and, with it, stowaways named Rey, Finn, and the droid BB-8. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the assault to destroy Starkiller Base, a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet Ahch-To on the Falcon, where they found Luke Skywalker. After Solo's death, Chewbacca often served as the sole pilot of the Falcon, including piloting the ship to aid the Resistance during the Battle of Crait.
Roughly a year after the battle of Crait, Chewbacca was one of the last of the Resistance. Having learned of the mysterious return of the Emperor, Chewbacca and the crew of the Falcon, now including Poe Dameron, traveled to the planets Pasaana and Kijimi to find a clue to how to find where the Emperor was hiding, being reunited with his friend Calrissian in the process. The quest nearly ended in Chewie's death, as Rey, having been revealed to be the Emperor's granddaughter through his son, lashed out with dark power during a fight with Kylo Ren and destroyed a First Order transport that she had thought Chewie had been loaded onto, seemingly killing him.
However, Chewie survived and was rescued by the Resistance as they continued the quest. Rey eventually found Exegol during a failed self-exile attempt to protect the galaxy from her becoming a Sith, and led the charge during the battle that ensued later on. Rey ultimately killed her malevolent grandfather with the help of the returned Ben Solo in the climax of the battle, while the Resistance, joined by the citizens' fleet, progressively overpowered the Sith fleet that the Emperor planned to unleash.
Having destroyed the Sith once and for all, the Resistance reveled in their victory, but also mourned their losses, including Leia, who had died of natural causes shortly after reaching out to her son and helping him turn back towards the light."
Han Solo,brown,male,Human,"Han Solo, known only as Han until being given the surname Solo by an Imperial recruitment officer, and formerly known as Cadet 124-329 while serving as an Imperial cadet, was a human male smuggler. He became a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. He hailed from Corellia and became a smuggler, even completing the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon, and coming under the employ of Jabba the Hutt. He was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, husband of Princess Leia Organa, brother-in-law of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted copilot who swore a life debt to the Corellian smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of money as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan, but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Leia Organa escape from the Death Star, briefly fought in the Battle of Yavin, which allowed Skywalker to destroy the superweapon. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of years afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.
After the Battle of Hoth, Solo sought refuge with Organawith whom he had fallen in loveChewbacca, and C-3PO on Cloud City, which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the Sith Lord Darth Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the city. Solo was frozen in carbonite and taken to Jabba's Palace on Tatooine by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, where he remained encased in carbonite for months until he was rescued by his friends. After returning to the Alliance Fleet, Solo was promoted to the rank of general and was given command of the Pathfinders, a special forces squad, for the Battle of Endor. Solo led the Pathfinders to Endor, where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native Ewoks, destroyed the shield generator protecting the second Death Star that was being constructed in orbit. Their actions allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the superweapon.
The Battle of Endor, which saw the deaths of Emperor Sheev Palpatine and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the New Republic. In the early days after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He married Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the dark side of the Forcelike his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was Force-sensitiveso Organa sent him to be trained as a Jedi by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by Snoke, Supreme Leader of the First Order, resulting in the destruction of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order.
Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the Millennium Falcon to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a scavenger named Rey and a defected First Order stormtrooper named Finn, who carried with them a droid, BB-8, that had part of a map to Skywalker's location. Solo, who retrieved the Falcon from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the Resistance against the First Order, and fought in the battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with his lightsaber. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon. However, Solo's memory remained alive and appeared in a Force vision a year later to convince Ren to abandon the dark side and defeat the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, after a duel on the remains of the second Death Star between Rey and Ren, being enough for Ben Solo to return and eventually sacrifice his own life to rescue Rey."
Greedo,black,male,Rodian,"Greedo was a male Rodian bounty hunter who grew up on Tatooine in Mos Espa. During the Clone Wars, he was hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Chi Eekway Papanoida and Che Amanwe Papanoida, the daughters of Chairman Papanoida, but was forced by the chairman to lead him and his son Ion to them. He was occasionally hired by crime lord Jabba the Hutt for various mercenary jobs, including the capture of Han Solo, who killed the luckless Rodian."
Jabba Desilijic Tiure,orange,hermaphrodite,Hutt,"Jabba Desilijic Tiure, more commonly referred to as Jabba the Hutt or simply Jabba, and formally styled as His Excellency Jabba Desilijic Tiure of Nal Hutta, Eminence of Tatooine, was a Hutt gangster and crime lord, as well as a member of the Grand Hutt Council, who operated and led a criminal empire from his palace on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. Jabba was a major figure on Tatooine, where he controlled the bulk of the trafficking in illegal goods, piracy and slavery that generated most of the planet's wealth. He was also highly influential in the entire Outer Rim as one of its most powerful crime lords.
During the Clone Wars, Jabba's influence and power over the Outer Rim, specifically its hyperlanes, was sought by both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who both courted Jabba's approval. When Rotta, Jabba's son, was kidnapped, the crime lord promised his support to whoever returned his son. When the Separatists were revealed to have orchestrated Rotta's kidnapping, Jabba pledged his support to the Republic.
Jabba continued to operate in the Outer Rim after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, preserving his power base, despite the interference of Darth Sidious, the Galactic Emperor. After the destruction of the Death Star by the Rebel Alliance, the Emperor sent Darth Vader to negotiate a deal with Jabba to secure raw materials for Imperial military production. Jabba's alliance with the Empire allowed him and the Hutts to survive the Imperial crackdown against criminal elements in the Outer Rim, as well as rid the Hutt of his competitors.
After the smuggler Han Solo failed to repay him for lost cargo, Jabba placed a high price on his head. Solo was eventually delivered to him by one of his bounty hunters, Boba Fett, as a gift from Darth Vader. However, this capture brought him to the attention of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who sought to rescue his friend from Jabba's imprisonment. As he attempted to execute the Jedi and his allies in the Great Pit of Carkoon, Jabba was choked to death by Leia Organa. With the Hutts unable to decide who would inherit Jabba's criminal ventures, many of his slaves, including the Niktos, were free, and his palace was abandoned after the droid pool was deactivated."
Wedge Antilles,hazel,male,Human,"Wedge Antilles, known as TIE SS-2-5 during his time at Skystrike Academy, was a renowned human male starfighter pilot from Corellia who first served in the Imperial Navy as a TIE fighter pilot until defecting to join the rebellion. He would also serve in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and years later the New Republic during their fight against the Galactic Empire. He became a member of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War and fought in several battles of the war. He fought in the Battle of Yavin, where he flew in Red Squadron alongside Luke Skywalker. After Skywalker destroyed the Death Star, he and Antilles were left as the only survivors of Red Squadron.
In the years that followed, Antilles became a respected member of Rogue Squadron, flying as Rogue Three during the Battle of Hoth. Antilles and his gunner Wes Janson became the first duo to successfully destroy one of the All Terrain Armored Transports that were attempting to destroy Echo Base, the Rebel outpost on the planet Hoth, while aboard an T-47 airspeeder. Six months after the evacuation from Hoth, Antilles commanded Red Squadron during the Battle of Endor, and he and General Lando Calrissian destroyed the second Death Star during the battle. The decisive battle led to the death of the Emperor, Darth Sidious, and left the Empire shattered in their defeat.
The Rebel Alliance soon reorganized into the New Republic, and Antilles continued to serve in their war against the now weakened Empire. Antilles undertook a lone reconnaissance mission to the planet Akiva, where he was captured while observing a gathering of Imperial forces that were preparing for a counterattack against the Republic. Following the rebellion on Akiva, Antilles formed Phantom Squadron and took part in the liberation of Kashyyyk. While Phantom Squadron was disbanded by the New Republic authorities for launching an unauthorized strike on Kashyyyk, Wedge was able to reform the squadron in time for the Battle of Jakku, which saw the definitive defeat of the Empire.
Following the signing of the Galactic Concordance, Antilles retired to Hosnian Prime to work as a flight instructor. Sometime afterwards Wedge married Norra Wexley and settled back on Akiva until they were visited by Norra's son Temmin and his wife Karé Kun during the war between the Resistance and the First Order.
In 35 ABY, Wedge fought alongside Rebel veterans Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca over Exegol against the Sith Eternal fleet of the resurrected Darth Sidious."
Jek Tono Porkins,blue,male,Human,"Jek Tono Porkins was a trader and pilot from Bestine IV who, along with the other Bestines, was forced to abandon his homeworld when the Galactic Empire chose it as the site of a new military base. Seeking the opportunity to strike back at the Empire, Porkins joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic and was assigned to Tierfon Rebel Outpost for pilot training with the Tierfon Yellow Aces. His skill at low-altitude strafing runs and his rotund physique earned him the nicknames ""Belly Runner"" and ""Piggy."" After the completion of the Empire's Death Star, the Yellow Aces were taken to fully active status and transferred to fill gaps in pilot rosters at other Rebel bases. When Porkins's good friend Wes Janson was taken ill with a case of Hesken Fever, Porkins was given his friend's assignment instead and transferred to Red Squadron, operating out of the Great Temple on Yavin 4.
Porkins soon took part in his first missions with Red Squadron, working with Biggs Darklighter, Wedge Antilles, and Cesi Eirriss to help retrieve a number of astromech droids from the smuggler Nera Dantels on Commenor. The group returned to Yavin 4 just before the arrival of the Death Star in the Yavin system, on a mission to destroy the Rebel base. Porkins flew as Red Six during the Battle of Yavin, his skills at strafing aiding the Rebels early in the battle. However, when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions, Porkins was hit by enemy turbolaser fire and killed."
Yoda,brown,male,Yoda's species,"Yoda, a Force-sensitive male being belonging to a mysterious species, was a legendary Jedi Master who witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Republic, followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire. Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order. Having lived through nine centuries of galactic history, he played integral roles in the Clone Wars, the rebirth of the Jedi through Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.
Born in 896 BBY, Yoda was almost nine hundred years old in the latter days of the Republic. A leading member of the Jedi High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, the maverick Qui-Gon Jinn introduced Anakin Skywalker to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied Chosen One. The Jedi elders sensed that the boy was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the Jedi Code. After Jinn's death during the liberation of Naboo, the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Yoda's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same time, the Jedi discovered that their ancient nemesis, the Sith, had returned after a millennium in hiding. Aware of the Rule of Two, Yoda was convinced that at least one more Sith Lord remained active following Obi-Wan Kenobi's victory over the Sith apprentice Darth Maul.
Over the next decade, the galaxy was on the verge of civil war with entire star systemsled by Count Dooku, Yoda's one-time Padawanthreatening to secede from the Republic by 22 BBY. Unable to defend the entire Republic on their own, the Jedi took command of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic, with Yoda himself leading an army of clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the first battle of the Clone Wars. For three years Yoda led the Republic military's war effort as a Jedi General, determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict, but his efforts were undermined by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to power. After the Great Jedi Purge commenced in 19 BBY, killing thousands of Jedi both on Coruscant and across the galaxy, Yoda confronted the self-declared Galactic Emperor but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into exile, leaving the Sith Master to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Anakin Skywalker-turned-Darth Vader, at his side. His remaining years were spent living in isolation on the remote world of Dagobah until Anakin's son Luke Skywalker sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a Jedi Knight. A year later, with his health rapidly declining, Yoda died of old age and became one with the Force in 4 ABY."
Palpatine,yellow,male,Human,"Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, was a Force-sensitive Human male who served as the last Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and the first Emperor of the Galactic Empire. A Dark Lord of the Sith in the Order of the Sith Lords, recorded by history as the most successful who had ever lived, his deeds resulted in overthrow the ancient Republic and the noble Jedi Order from within. Noted for his sadistic and self-serving intentions just as well as his ability to conceal them, Palpatine impacted the galaxy perhaps more than any other single individual, and it is likely that his impact on history, for good or ill, was immeasurable.
Born in 82 BBY on the planet Naboo to the aristocratic House Palpatine, Palpatine discovered the Sith at a young age as a collector of dark side artifacts. In 65 BBY, he met Hego Damask, a Muun businessman who was in reality the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Under Plagueis's manipulation, Palpatine killed his father and pledged himself to his new Master's dark side teachings as Darth Sidious. Palpatine lived a double life for many years, serving an untarnished career as Naboo's ambassador in the Galactic Senate while learning from his master and training a young Zabrak as the Sith assassin Darth Maul. Plagueis and Sidious, both exceptionally skilled and powerful in the Force, were able to conceal their identities from the Jedi for decades. As Plagueis privately searched for the key to eternal life, Sidious manipulated galactic politics, culminating in the blockade of Naboo by the Trade Federation. In the wake of the political crisis, the Galactic Senate voted to elect him as Supreme Chancellor, and around the same time, in accordance with Bane's Rule of Two, Sidious murdered Plagueis and usurped the role of Sith Master.
As Chancellor of the Republic and Dark Lord of the Sith, Palpatine orchestrated the outbreak of the devastating Clone Wars ten years after the Naboo Crisis. He himself headed both the Galactic Republic and, secretly, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The public leader of this splinter faction was former Jedi Master Count Dooku, Sidious's second apprentice as Darth Tyranus in the wake of Maul's presumed death on Naboo. As billions perished in the war, the vast majority of Republic citizens rallied behind Chancellor Palpatine, giving him enough support to amend the Galactic Constitution in the name of security and transfer most of the Senate's executive authority to his own office. In 19 BBY, following Tyranus' demise, Palpatine revealed his identity as Darth Sidious to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, telling that the dark side teachings that Plagueis had pursued could help Skywalker to save his wife, whom Skywalker had foreseen dying untimely. A failed attempt by the Jedi High Council to arrest Palpatine ensued, and Skywalker pledged himself to Sidious' teachings as Darth Vader. All members of the Jedi Order were accused of treason and betrayed by their clone troopers to the point of virtual extermination. Without the Jedi to oppose him, Sidious declared himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire, bringing an end to the Republic that had stood for over 25,000 years.
As Emperor, Sidious effectively wielded absolute control over the entire galaxy and virtually everyone who lived within it. During his tenure, he built one of the most powerful military forces the galaxy had ever seen and ruled unopposed for nearly two decades. Sidious progressively abandoned his facade of being an enlightened leader and began to rule through terror symbolized by the Death Star, a superweapon that could annihilate entire planets. However, he later discovered that Vader was training Galen Marek, an exceptionally powerful Force adept as a secret apprentice ""Starkiller."" When Sidious discovered Starkiller's existence in 3 BBY, he ordered Vader to fake Starkiller's death and then request that Starkiller assemble the most influential traitors in the Empire in a rebellion in order to highlight and destroy them all. Sidious's plan backfired when Starkiller, healed from his near-fatal injuries and espousing the teachings of the light side, vowed revenge against Sidious and confronted him on the Death Star, ultimately sacrificing himself in an act that inspired the dissident senators to create the Alliance to Restore the Republic. As the Galactic Civil War broke out, Emperor Palpatine ironically fought against a rebellion that he started in secret. After the Empire suffered a devastating defeat in 0 BBY, in which the Alliance destroyed the Death Star, the Emperor steadily began to lose his absolute control over the galaxy.
In 4 ABY, Sidious gambled his chances in order to annihilate the Rebel Alliance once and for all, allowing Rebel spies to learn of the existence of a second Death Star and its secret location near Endor. As expected, the Alliance fell for the bait and dispatched its fleet to destroy the Emperor, Vader, and the incomplete Death Star. With the Alliance soon falling for his trap, Sidious brought Luke Skywalker, the son of Darth Vader, before him in order to turn him over to the dark side and replace Vader with an apprentice who was younger and more powerful. After goading Skywalker to give into his frustrations with thoughts of the Alliance's defeat and the death of his friends, the Dark Lord eagerly watched as father and son fought one another. However, Skywalker refused to submit to the dark side and spared his father, prompting Sidious to unleash all of his rage and hatred on Skywalker. Unwilling to stand by and watch his son die from the agonizing effects of Sidious' Force lightning, Anakin Skywalker finally redeemed himself, throwing his astonished Master down the Death Star's shaft, a sacrifice that fulfilled the prophecy of the Chosen One and brought about the end of the Order of the Sith Lords.
Throughout the rest of the Galactic Civil War, the remnants of the Empire experienced a sharp decline while the Alliance reformed itself into the New Republic. However, Sidious did not stay dead, and eventually used a rare and ancient Force technique to transfer his spirit into one of many clone bodies stored on the Deep Core world of Byss. In 10 ABY, Darth Sidious resurfaced in the galaxy in a bid to rebuild his Empire, temporarily converting Luke Skywalker to the dark side and installing him as his apprentice. Sidious's efforts to live forever, however, were undermined by subversives within his own inner circle, including his Royal Guard Carnor Jax. With the last supplies of healthy clone bodies sabotaged and their genetic source material contaminated by his allies, Sidious desperately tried to take over the body of Darth Vader's youngest grandchild, the infant Anakin Solo, in 11 ABY. Sidious's spirit, however, was intercepted by the dying Jedi Knight Empatojayos Brand, who dragged the Dark Lord down into the depths of the Force forever, though his legacy continued to live for countless years."
Boba Fett,brown,male,Human,"Boba Fett was a Mandalorian warrior and bounty hunter. He was the only unaltered clone of the famed Jango Fett, created in 32 BBY as unit A0050, one of the first of many Fett replicas designed to become part of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was raised as Jango's son. Jango taught Boba much, training him to become a skilled bounty hunter as was his father-figure before him. In 22 BBY, Jango was killed at the Battle of Geonosis, which opened the Clone Wars. Just a boy, Boba was forced to grow up and took to traveling the galaxy. Later, he became a bounty hunter and took assignments from beings such as Jabba the Hutt, and achieved notoriety despite his young age.
When the Empire was formed in 19 BBY, it was the perfect environment for Fett. During this time, he also married Sintas Vel and had a daughter named Ailyn Vel. Fett became known as the galaxy's best bounty hunter of the next several decades, often working for the Empire. He collaborated with Darth Vader on several occasions, and the Sith Lord even developed a grudging respect for Fett.
In 1 BBY, a year after the Galactic Civil War had begun, Fett was hired to kidnap the Rebel captain Juno Eclipse in order to lure out a clone of Galen Marek. Fett also participated in the Battle of Kamino. When Darth Vader was captured and about to be interrogated on Dantooine, the Mandalorian bounty hunter trailed the Rogue Shadow there.
Fett made his most notable bounty in 3 ABY, when he captured Rebel hero Han Solo, and delivered him to Jabba the Hutt. A year later, during the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, Fett fought against the group of Rebel rescuers. He was inadvertently knocked into the mouth of the Sarlacc by Solo. Though no one in recorded history had ever escaped from the Sarlacc, Fett was able to escape, though not unscathed. Thanks to his iron will and Mandalorian armor, he was able to fight his way out of the beast's belly. Back in action, he resumed his work as a bounty hunter.
After a promise made to a dying Fenn Shysa, Fett became Mandalore and eventually led the Mandalorians through the Yuuzhan Vong War. Originally working as a mercenary for the extra-galactic invaders, Fett later aided the New Republic in their battle against the aliens. When the Yuuzhan Vong assaulted Mandalore and bombarded the planet's surface, a large deposit of Mandalorian iron was unearthed, ironically helping to strengthen the Mandalorians.
Later, during the Second Galactic Civil War, Boba, who was still leading the Mandalorians, was plagued by ailing health. He found his granddaughter, Mirta Gev, and the two went on many missions together, even alongside Han Solo. Fett also trained Solo's daughter Jaina to kill her twin brother, Darth Caedus, and assisted the Jedi Coalition in several battles. Ultimately, Fett's training helped Jaina bring down Caedus, though an Imperial nanovirus attack prevented Fett from ever returning to Mandalore."
IG-88,red,none,Droid,"IG-88, also known as IG-88B, or as a Phlutdroid, was a rogue, deadly masculine IG-series assassin droid manufactured by Holowan Laboratories who worked as a bounty hunter. Following the Battle of Hoth, he and several other bounty hunters were summoned by Darth Vader to the Executor and hired to track down the Millennium Falcon and her Rebel crew. Unable to track his quarry, IG-88 trailed his chief rival, Boba Fett, to Bespin, where the bounty hunter nearly destroyed the assassin droid, however IG-88 managed to survive. At some point IG-88 undertook a software infiltration into Death Star II, but his plan was single-handedly thwarted by R2-Q5. The droid later met with mercenary Bazine Netal to speak about the location of the Millennium Falcon."
Bossk,red,male,Trandoshan,"Bossk (whose name meant ""devours his prey"" in Dosh) was a male Trandoshan bounty hunter who was the pilot of the Hound's Tooth and held the title of monarch of the Qotile system.[5] He was also an old enemy and rival for Chewbacca and his Human partner Han Solo. He would face them several times, and would unsurprisingly be one of the six bounty hunters Darth Vader hired to track down and capture the Millennium Falcon. Despite the fact that Bossk loved to hunt and skin Wookiees, he would unknowingly aid in the freeing of hundreds of Wookiee slaves on the island world of Lomabu III. He was also a frequent partner and foe of both Boba Fett and Zuckuss, both fellow bounty hunters. After being repeatedly beaten by Boba Fett, Bossk would eventually boost his reputation as a bounty hunter by defeating Fett on Tatooine."
Lando Calrissian,brown,male,Human,"Lando Calrissian was a Human male professional gambler, entrepreneur, smuggler, and general throughout various points in his life. Born on Socorro, he became a gambler and con man early in his life and acquired his own ship, the Millennium Falcon, in a game of sabacc with a man named Cix Trouvee. He went on to have numerous adventures with the Falcon and its piloting droid, Vuffi Raa, during which he ran afoul of a Sorcerer of Tund named Rokur Gepta, whom Calrissian eventually killed. After a series of events led to him losing the Millennium Falcon to a Corellian named Han Solo on Bespin, Calrissian eventually became the Baron Administrator of Cloud City for a timea position he once again gained through sabacc.
In 3 ABY, Cloud City was taken over by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War as part of a deal gone wrong. Calrissian had previously agreed to turn over a group of Rebels to the Empire, including Han Solo and Leia Organa, as part of bait for a trap for Jedi Luke Skywalker. However, Darth Vader altered the deal to the point where Calrissian felt he was no longer able to tolerate it. Subsequently, he joined the Rebel Alliance and took part in numerous missions on its behalf; in particular, in search for Han Solo, who had been frozen in carbonite due to Calrissian's betrayal on Bespin. Calrissian eventually participated in Solo's rescue and the defeat of Jabba the Hutt. Following Solo's rescue, Calrissian continued to serve with the Alliance and during the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY, Calrissian piloted his old ship, the Millennium Falcon, into the second Death Star's core to destroy its reactor.
Afterward, he continued to serve the newly formed New Republic in times of need, but spent most of his time pursuing various business ventures, specializing in mining. A venture on the sun-baked world of Nkllon was soured by multiple attacks from the Empire under Grand Admiral Thrawn, but Calrissian invested in a number of other entrepreneurial plans, including mining operations on Varn and Kessel. In 18 ABY, Calrissian met and fell in love with Tendra Risant, marrying her soon after the Bastion Accords were signed. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Calrissian aided the New Republic through his leadership and the YVH 1 droids that his company, Tendrando Arms, produced to combat the extragalactic invaders. He also helped to arrange the election of Cal Omas as Chief of State following the New Republic's reorganization into the Galactic Alliance.
Calrissian, along with his wife Tendra, continued to manage Tendrando Arms following the war. His YVH droids played significant roles in the subsequent Dark Nest Crisis, Swarm War, and Second Galactic Civil War. During the latter conflict, Calrissian aided his friends Han and Leia Solo in their efforts against their son Jacen Solo, who had fallen to the dark side and become a Sith, until Calrissian was informed that Tendra was pregnant; he then spent the rest of the war with her. After the war's conclusion, Calrissian settled down with Tendra in a life of quiet luxury, managing Tendrando Arms and raising his son, Lando Calrissian, Junior. He was later contacted by Luke Skywalker for assistance during a mission to the Maw with Skywalker's Sith allies. Calrissian reluctantly agreed, and successfully carried out the mission. Afterward, he returned to Coruscant and warned the Jedi of not only the danger posed by the Sith, but also the hidden menace which Skywalker and the Sith were pursuing. To that end, he assisted in getting a large number of Jedi StealthX wing starfighters offworld to assist the Skywalkers."
Lobot,blue,male,Human,"Lobot, also known by the nickname Lo, was a male human from the planet Bespin who, with the assistance of his AJ^6 cyborg construct, was paid to run battlefield calculations for the Galactic Empire. However, he eventually began working with the smuggler Lando Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon, running numerous criminal jobs. During one job, the theft of the Emperor's personal yacht, Lobot was gravely wounded by an Imperial Guard. In his injured state, Lobot's mind was lost and his cybernetic implants took over. In the time to come, Calrissian became Baron Administrator of Cloud City on Lobot's homeworld of Bespin, and Lobot served as his aide and chef. As the city's computer-liaison officer, his implants enabled him to communicate with the city's central network. During the Empire's takeover of Cloud City, Lando ordered Lobot to gather their security forces to outflank the stormtroopers. Although they successfully helped evacuate the city by rounding up the stormtroopers, the city soon fell to the Empire and Lobot was captured. Following the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor, Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard tightened his grip on the Anoat sector, home to Bespin, forming the Iron Blockade. Receiving support from the New Republic, Lobot fought to liberate his homeworld. "
Ackbar,orange,male,Mon Calamari,"Gial Ackbar was a veteran male Mon Calamari soldier and strong revolutionary leader during the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, the Cold War, and the war between the Resistance and the First Order. Throughout his sixty years of service, Ackbar was regarded as a brilliant tactician.
Ackbar was captain of the Mon Calamari Guard during the Clone Wars and fought in the Battle of Mon Cala, in which he helped to secure Prince Lee-Char's ascent as King of Mon Cala and repel the Confederacy of Independent Systems. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ackbar became the foremost military commander in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, emerging as a symbol of defiance against the Empire's subjugation of non-humans. His presence attracted Mon Calamari support for the Alliance, thus supplying the Mon Calamari star cruisers that made up a bulk of the Alliance Fleet.
From his command ship of Home One, supreme commander Ackbar acted as the fleet commander during the Battle of Endor, in which the Alliance successfully mounted an attack that led to the destruction of the Empire's second Death Star and the death of Emperor Palpatine. After the Battle of Endor, the Alliance formed the New Republic. Ackbar became a fleet admiral of the New Republic Defense Fleet and led the Republic to its victory over the Empire during the Battle of Jakku. After the battle on Jakku ended, the Empire retreated into the Unknown Regions and Ackbar retired to Mon Cala.
By 34 ABY, the emerging threat of the First Order, which arose from the ashes of the Empire, led Princess Leia Organa to form the Resistance without the support of the Republic that had turned a blind eye to the First Order. Organa, the general of the Resistance, coaxed Ackbar out of his retirement to serve in the Resistance. After reclaiming his commission as an Admiral, Ackbar served in the Resistance base on D'Qar, where he helped oversee the battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base.
Ackbar was later present on the bridge of the Resistance's flagship the Raddus when the Resistance evacuated from D'Qar, but he was killed when two First Order TIE/sf space superiority fighters attacked the ship after it exited hyperspace."
Mon Mothma,blue,female,Human,"Mon Mothma was a human female politician and revolutionary leader who served in the Galactic Senate and Imperial Senate as the representative of Chandrila, the leader of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and the first Chancellor of the New Republic. Mothma came to political prominence during the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars when, along with such allies as Senators Bail Organa and Padmé Amidala, she became an outspoken proponent of peace between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. She also spoke out against the increase in executive power given to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who transformed the Republic into the Empire at the war's end.
Mothma worked with Organa and other allies to plant the seeds of rebellion against the Imperial regime. Mothma left the Senate after publicly denouncing Emperor Palpatine, which was soon followed by the establishment of the Rebel Alliance. Mothma sanctioned the recruitment of Jyn Erso, who led the Rogue One squadron in stealing the Death Star plans during the Battle of Scarif. After the Battle of Yavin saw the destruction of the Death Star, Mothma led the Alliance through the Galactic Civil War. The Battle of Endor, which Mothma helped plan with the Alliance High Command, saw the first death of Emperor Palpatine and left the Empire in chaos.
In Endor's aftermath, the Rebellion formed the New Republic and headquartered the new Galactic Senate on Chandrila. Mothma was elected as the first chancellor of the New Republic Senate and intended to do away with Palpatine's emergency powers, which the Senate gave to the office of the New Republic chancellery. She also intended to demilitarize the Republic, hoping to cut the New Republic Defense Fleet by ninety percent while leaving the defense of member worlds to the worlds themselves. When the war with the Empire finally came to end, the Republic and the Imperial remnants signed the Galactic Concordance and the Republic passed the Military Disarmament Act. The end of Mothma's chancellery brought a close to a period of unity in the Republic, with several political factions, such as the Centrists and the Populists, breaking out in disagreement over the best future for the new government."
Arvel Crynyd,brown,male,Human,"Arvel Crynyd was a male human pilot who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. In the war's fourth year, Commander Crynyd participated in the Rebellion's attack on the Galactic Empire's second Death Star in the Battle of Endor, flying an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor in Green Squadron as leader of the squadron. When Crynyd was killed during the battle in a suicide run to destroy the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Lieutenant L'ulo L'ampar assumed command of the squadron. The battle ended soon after, seeing the destruction of the Death Star and death of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine.
Arvel Crynyd was a male human who flew as a Z-95 Headhunter pilot for a Thyferran bacta cartel before joining the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[3] With the Alliance, he fought in the Galactic Civil War, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Alliance and the Galactic Empire.[2] Holding the rank of commander,[4] Crynyd flew as a pilot in Green Squadron, operating an RZ-1 A-wing interceptor[2] In 4 ABY,[1] after the Bothan spynet discovered that Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine would be aboard the second Death Star to oversee its construction, Alliance High Command determined that launching an immediate assault on the space station would be their only chance to cripple the Empire.
With the full Alliance Fleet, Crynyd, under the callsign of Green Leader, exited hyperspace above the forest moon of Endor, approaching the superweapon in his A-wing. He was the last squadron leader to report stand-by status and prepared to attack the Death Star, but pulled up at the last second on General Lando Calrissian's orders when it was revealed that the shield was still up. Green Squadron was ordered to stick close to Sector MV-7 as a massive flotilla of Star Destroyers emerged from the other side of the moon. The Alliance had walked right into a trap, but were determined to go down fighting. Initially, both sides fought with only their starfighters to the rebels' confusion, but this turned to horror when the Death Star proved itself to be fully operational, firing its superlaser on the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser Liberty and reducing it to atoms. Following the advice of Calrissian, the remaining Rebel forces moved up alongside the Star Destroyers and fought at point-blank range, hoping the Death Star wouldn't dare shoot into its own fleet.
When the shield protecting the Death Star was disabled, several fighters broke off and headed for it to destroy the reactor. To buy them time, Crynyd and his squadron attacked the Imperial flagship, the mighty Super Star Destroyer Executor, with two A-wings knocking out its bridge deflector shields. In response, Admiral Firmus Piett ordered the forward batteries to increase forward firing to prevent any window of opportunity from being exploited. As Crynyd attempted a trench run through the ship's superstructure, his fighter was struck by a laser bolt and spun wildly. Realizing he was doomed, Crynyd managed to wrestle what little control he had over his starfighter and put it on a collision course with the Executor's unshielded bridge tower. Letting out one last cry of defiance, Crynyd's ship crashed through the bridge windows and exploded, killing himself alongside Piett and the entire bridge crew.
Without its command structure, the Executor lost primary power and plunged into the Death Star's gravity well, colliding with the station and detonating in a massive fireball. Crynyd's sacrifice tipped the battle in the Alliance's favor, with the Death Star being destroyed shortly after

Wicket Systri Warrick,brown,male,Ewok,"Wicket Wystri Warrick was a male Ewok scout, warrior and later Chief of Bright Tree Village on the forest moon of Endor. The great-grandson of Erpham Warrick, Wicket was the third son of Deej and Shodu Warrick, following Weechee and Willy and was the older brother of Winda.
Wicket led an adventurous life, even from a very young age. He and his friends, namely Teebo and Princess Kneesaa, continually protected their village and the surrounding forest from those who would do them harm, such as Morag the Tulgah witch, the Duloks, and other threats from Endor and beyond. He almost even inadvertently killed Emperor Palpatine while defending the sunstar during Doctor Raygar's quest for Imperial domination.
Wicket aided the Towani family when they crash-landed on Endor and later assisted Noa Briqualon in the battle against the Sanyassans. Wicket also played an instrumental role in helping the Rebel Alliance defeat the Galactic Empire during the Battle of Endor. After the death of Chief Chirpa, Wicket and his bride, Kneesaa, ruled over Bright Tree Village together."
Nien Nunb,black,male,Sullustan,"Nien Nunb was a Sullustan male arms dealer and smuggler who joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Nunb answered the call from his friend, Rebel pilot Evaan Verlaine, to help smuggle a group of Alderaanians off of Sullust while avoiding detection from the Galactic Empire; the Empire was searching for surviving Alderaanians after Death Star I blew up its first planet, Alderaan. He went on to further assist Verlaine and Princess Leia Organa in their mission to unite the surviving Alderaanians, during which time he helped Organa escape from potential Imperial captivity.
Only a few years later, Nunb became part of the Alliance Fleet and flew as the co-pilot for General Lando Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon during the Battle of Endor. Together, they fought against Imperial forces while attempting to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station in orbit of the forest moon of Endor. Their battle was a success, and the Millennium Falcon fired the shot that destroyed the second Death Star and delivered a devastating blow to the Galactic Empire.
Three decades later, Nunb was a starfighter pilot with the military rank of Lieutenant Commander in the Resistance and fought in the Cold War, including the Battle of Starkiller Base. After the Battle of Crait Nunb was left as one of the few surviving Resistance members and successfully escaped with the remainder of the Resistance. One year later, in 35 ABY Nunb fought in the decisive battle against the Sith Eternal piloting the Tantive IV alongside Urcos Furdam. However, during the battle, the Tantive IV was disabled by Darth Sidious' massive burst of Force lightning and Nunb perished."
Qui-Gon Jinn,blue,male,Human,"Qui-Gon Jinn was a Force-sensitive highly respected, yet maverick and unconventional Human male Jedi Master, who lived during the last decades of the Galactic Republic and was most notably responsible for discovering Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One of the Jedi prophecy, and bringing him into the Jedi Order. An adherent of the Living Force, Jinn always kept his focus in the moment and often clashed with and even openly defied the Jedi High Council. Born in 92 BBY, Qui-Gon Jinn was raised at the Jedi Temple on the galactic capital of Coruscant before being apprenticed at the age of ten to Jedi Knight Dooku. After years of training under Dooku, Jinn achieved the rank of Jedi Knight andafter successfully training a Padawan of his own, a farmer's son named Feemorbecame a Jedi Master himself. Shortly after that, Jinn took on a second Padawan, a prodigy named Xanatos, whom Jinn had himself discovered and had brought to the Jedi Temple earlier. Jinn was marveled by his Padawan's prowess so much that he turned a blind eye to Xanatos's flaws, namely his desire for power.

However, Jinn was faced with his Padawan's true nature during a mission to stop a civil war on Xanatos's homeworld of Telos IV. During the mission, Xanatos fell to the dark side of the Force and sided with his father Crion, the power-hungry Governor of the planet, who had orchestrated the insurgency to further his own goals. In order to stop the war, Jinn had to confront Crion, who was accidentally killed in the process. Xanatos fled from the planet, swearing revenge on his Master. Devastated by his apprentice's betrayal, Jinn blamed himself for Xanatos's fall, believing in his inability as a Master and renouncing his earlier success with Feemor. Jinn swore never to take another apprentice, until he crossed paths with a Jedi trainee named Obi-Wan Kenobi during a mission to the planet Bandomeer in 44 BBY. Jinn took Kenobi as his third apprentice, starting their long training together. Over the course of the next twelve years, Jinn and Kenobi participated in numerous missions across the galaxy, most notably fighting side by side against Xanatos, who attempted to exact revenge on his former Master. Ultimately, the fallen apprentice took his own life when cornered by Jinn and his new Padawan on Telos, ending that dark chapter in Jinn's life.

In 32 BBY, Jinn and Kenobi were assigned by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum as ambassadors to the Trade Federation, which had recently blockaded the planet Naboo in protest against the recent taxation laws introduced by the Galactic Senate. The Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray, however, attempted to dispose of the Jedi, launching an invasion of Naboo. Escaping to the surface of the planet, Jinn and Kenobi saved the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, agreeing to escort her to Coruscant in order to report the Trade Federation's act of aggression, but their ship's hyperdrive was damaged, forcing them to make a stop for repairs on the lawless world of Tatooine. It was under the twin suns of Tatooine that Jinn discovered Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy with great Force potential, who helped the Jedi obtain the money to buy the replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator by risking his life at the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. Convinced that the boy was the Chosen One who was supposed to bring balance to the Force, Jinn secured Skywalker's release from slavery and brought him to the Jedi Temple, narrowly escaping from an attack by the Sith Lord Darth Maul in the process.

Believing that Kenobi was ready to become a Jedi Knight, Jinn asked for Skywalker to be assigned as his new apprentice. However, the Jedi Council refused Jinn's request, believing Skywalker to be too old for Jedi training and potentially dangerous. Jinn then accompanied Amidala back to Naboo, helping her to liberate her world from the Trade Federation. During the battle, Jinn and Kenobi faced off against Darth Maul, and the Jedi Master was struck down by the Sith, before Kenobi cut him in half. With his final words, Jinn asked Kenobi to train Skywalker as his Padawan. Following the battle, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight, and Skywalker was accepted into the Jedi Order. Kenobi fulfilled his promise to his later Master, training Skywalker for the next ten years. Even though Jinn died on Naboo, he continued to have great influence on the future of the Jedi. Having long ago learned how to preserve one's consciousness with the Force, Jinn remained as a Force ghost, eventually passing the secret to Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda. Even though Skywalker fell to the dark sidebecoming the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader and leading to the fall of the Galactic Republic, the rise of the Galactic Empire in its stead and the near-destruction of the Jedi Orderhe eventually fulfilled the prophecy just as Jinn had foreseen, killing his Sith Master Darth Sidious and returning to the light in his final moments."
Nute Gunray,red,male,Neimodian,"Nute Gunray was a Neimoidian male who served as a stint Minister of the Trade Federation until he rose in power after the Stark Hyperspace War in 44 BBY, eventually becoming Viceroy of the Trade Federation. In 32 BBY, Gunray participated in the occupation of Naboo with the Federation Army to settle a trade dispute that began in the Galactic Senate. With the help of Darth Sidious, Gunray invaded the planet to end the trade dispute and secured all facilities in the capital of Theed. He attempted to force the incumbent Queen of Naboo Padmé Amidala to sign a treaty to make his invasion legal, however she refused and the Siege of Naboo continued. The Trade Federation soon surrendered to Naboo forces following the Battle of Naboo. Gunray was taken to the Galactic Republic capital on Coruscant to be charged with acts of war.

During the Separatist Crisis that following the Invasion of Naboo, Gunray confronted former Jedi Master, Count Dooku, who began a separatist movement that opposed the Republic. Dooku, who secretly was Sidious's Sith apprentice under the name of Darth Tyranus, helped him through his four trials in the Supreme Court, and soon after the trials, Gunray retained his position as Viceroy. The Trade Federation, under Gunray's command, joined Dooku's separatist movement and Gunray was named Head of the newly formed Separatist Council and so formed the Separatist Army. Gunray, along with Dooku and his master, Sidious, formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems which opposed the Galactic Republic in a three-year war known as the Clone Wars that followed after two years of the Separatist Crisis.

During the Clone Wars, Gunray tempted Onaconda Farr, the senator of Rodia, with an offer to join the Separatists and receive the aid and protection for Rodia that the Republic had failed to provide, in exchange for Farr luring Senator Amidala to the planet and handing her over to him. Gunray's plan ultimately failed and he was captured by the Republic and given to Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano. Dooku sent his Dark Jedi apprentice, Asajj Ventress, to rescue the Viceroy from the Republic forces. Stationed inside the Republic Star Destroyer, Senate Commando Faro Argyus released the Viceroy and met up with Ventress in Argyus's cruiser. Argyus was betrayed and murdered by Ventress, however, in a fit of rage over his arrogance.

In 19 BBY, the Separatist Council was moved to the volcanic planet of Mustafar from the sink hole planet of Utapau, after Separatist General Grievous became leader of the CIS after the death of Dooku. Following the death of Grievous at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi Nute Gunray became the new leader of the separatists. Gunray along with the other Separatist leaders were betrayed by Darth Sidious after he sent his new apprentice, Darth Vader, to Mustafar to end the war. Gunray was the last council member to be killed by Vader's lightsaber, which had ultimately brought an end to the Clone Wars and fragmented the CIS into various Separatist holdouts, in which they were represented by various ununited warlords across the galaxy."
Finis Valorum,blue,male,Human,"Finis Valorum was a human male politician from House Valorum who served as the penultimate Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. His administration was hampered by corruption and bureaucracy in the Galactic Senate, which Valorum was unable to bring under control.

Towards the end of his administration, Valorum attempted to resolve the Trade Federation's Invasion of Naboo to little effect. As a result of government inaction, Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo called for a Vote of No Confidence in Valorum's leadership. The Senate scheduled an election for a new Chancellor, and Valorum was replaced by Senator Sheev Palpatine of Naboo; Palpatine was secretly Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, and had orchestrated the Naboo Crisis to become Supreme Chancellor and, ultimately, transform the Republic into the Galactic Empire.

During the Clone Wars, over ten years after his political downfall, Valorum assisted the Jedi Order as they investigated the circumstances surrounding the death of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who, as Chancellor, Valorum had sent on a mission to resolve a dispute with the spice dealers known as the Pyke Syndicate. The Jedi learned Sifo-Dyas had been killed by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of the Sithwho wanted to control the clone army Sifo-Dyas had secretly commissioned for the Republicduring the mission that Valorum had sent him on. After the rise of the Empire, some Coruscanti continued to have fond memories of the former Supreme Chancellor."
Jar Jar Binks,orange,male,Gungan,"Jar Jar Binks was a Gungan male military commander and politician who played a key role in the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars that culminated in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Once an outcast from Gungan society due to his clumsy behavior, he regained favor with his people by helping secure an alliance between the Gungan boss Rugor Nass and Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo, an alliance vital in ending the Trade Federation's invasion of their shared homeworld. In the years that followed, Binks became a Junior Representative for his people in the Galactic Senate, serving alongside Amidala once she became the planet's senator.

Ten years after the Naboo Crisis, growing tensions between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems threatened an outbreak of full-scale galactic war. In the absence of Senator Amidala, whose life was under threat by Separatist assassins, Binks was convinced by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to propose that the chancellor receive emergency executive powers to raise a Grand Army of the Republic. The proposal passed, leading to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, during which time Binks participated in a number of diplomatic missions for the Galactic Senate.

The emergency powers Binks proposed were ultimately used by the chancellor, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, to amass total power and transform the Republic into the Empire. In the years that followed, Binks once again became an outcast on Naboo due to his role in the rise of the Empire. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Binks was a street performer in the capital city of Theed, where he was scorned by adults but beloved by the children who came to watch his antics."
Roos Tarpals,orange,male,Gungan,"Roos Tarpals was a Gungan male who served in the Gungan Grand Army during the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, he served as captain of a patrol in Otoh Gunga. After the Battle of Naboo, Tarpals was promoted to general. During the Clone Wars, he sacrificed himself to protect Naboo from being conquered by General Grievous.
Roos Tarpals was a Gungan warrior who served in the Gungan Grand Army during the Invasion of Naboo. He was acquainted with Jar Jar Binks, who was banished from Otoh Gunga because of his ""clumsiness."" During the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo, Binks returned with two Jedi emissariesMaster Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobiwho had come seeking help to get to the Naboo. Upon arriving, Tarpals and a colleague, who were riding kaadu, apprehended Binks. Tarpals warned Binks that he was in ""big doo-doo"" this time.[1]

Tarpals brought Binks and the two Jedi visitors before Boss Nass, the ruler of Otoh Gunga. Master Jinn saved Binks from punishment by enlisting his services as a guide to bring them to Theed, the capital of Naboo. Boss Nass reluctantly granted Binks clemency and sent him away. Later, Tarpals was present when the Naboo Queen Padmé Amidala convinced the Gungans and Naboo to put aside their differences so that they could defeat the Trade Federation invaders. As a reward for his role in bringing the Gungans and Naboo together, Jar Jar Binks was promoted to the position of Bombad General in the Gungan Grand Army.[1]

During the battle on the Grassy Plains, Tarpals served under the command of General Binks. Despite fighting bravely, the Grand Army was outnumbered and forced to retreat by the Trade Federation's droid army. During their chaotic retreat, Tarpals saved Binks from being killed by the battle droid commander of an AAT tank. Shortly thereafter, both Tarpals and Binks were captured by battle droids. However, the destruction of the orbiting Droid Control Ship disabled all of the battle droids, turning the tide of the battle in favor of the Gungans and their Naboo allies."
Rugor Nass,orange,male,Gungan,"Rugor Nass was a Gungan male who served as the Boss of the Gungan people during the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo. Nass governed the Gungans from the city of Otoh Gunga within Naboo's oceans, keeping a close eye on Gungan affairs and, for a time, ensuring that the Gungans and the human population of Naboo did not interact. He initially refused to help the Naboo during the invasion, rejecting Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi when they requested it, but ultimately had a change of heart when Queen Padmé Amidala knelt and pleaded her case before him in behalf of the Naboo and the Gungans, promising that administration the planet's affairs would be shared between the two races from that time forth. After the Battle of Naboo, in which the Naboo and the Gungans were victorious over the Federation, Nass joined Queen Amidala in peace. Nass' tenure as Boss ended sometime before or during the Clone Wars, and he attended Amidala's funeral after her death at the end of the war."
Ric Olié,blue,male,,"Ric Olié was a human male starship pilot who served in the Royal Naboo Security Forces. He was the commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps, and the leader of Bravo Flight. Olié's talents also landed him the job of the Queen's personal pilot, often flying the Naboo Royal Starship in the service of Padmé Amidala. Due to Naboo's pacifistic nature, Olié's skills were rarely in use, although he saw military action during the Invasion of Naboo. Following the battle, Olié suffered an inner-ear injury and was eventually succeeded as Naboo's royal pilot by Daneska Varbarós. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Olié had become part of the Amidalans, a resistance group of Naboo which desired to hunt down and kill those responsible for Amidala's mysterious death, facing the Sith Lord Darth Vader when the Sith was tricked into going to Naboo by Sabé so they could kill him for his role in the former queen's death."
Watto,yellow,male,Toydarian,"Watto was a male Toydarian junk dealer/Human trafficker, who owned a shop in Mos Espa, Tatooine. In his youth, he served as a soldier in the Ossiki Confederacy Army on his homeworld of Toydaria, but later left after sustaining permanently damaging injuries. Making his way to Tatooine, he fell in with the Jawa natives of the planet, and learned how to trade from them. Once he felt he had learned all he could, he abandoned the Jawas, and set up Watto's Shop in Mos Espa. He became one of Tatooine's many slave owners, and made a lucrative business for himself. Eventually, he came into possession of a young slave, Anakin Skywalker, who proved to be a gifted mechanic, and an invaluable asset to the running of the store. Soon enough, Watto discovered that the boy had an affinity for podracing.

Watto would often bet on the podraces, and was an avid fan, so he had Anakin race for him in several tournaments. Although the boy never won, he was clearly gifted. During one particular race, Anakin destroyed Watto's own podracer, which incurred the Toydarian's wrath. Shortly thereafter, a stranger to Mos Espa, Qui-Gon Jinn, claimed that he had his own podracer, and that he wanted Anakin to fly it in the Boonta Eve Classic. Watto conceded to the deal, but decided to bet against Anakin, instead investing in the Dug Sebulba. Jinn took the bet, wagering his ship against Anakin's freedom. Ultimately, Anakin won the race, and Watto was left with very little. His business declined, and he eventually had to sell Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker. Watto stayed in business until the Galactic Civil War, when he handed over ownership of his shop to his assistant, W. Wald."
Sebulba,orange,male,Dug,"Sebulba was a male Dug who hailed from the planet of Malastare. A vicious podracer pilot who flew a massive orange podracer with a split-x configuration, Sebulba would often bump and smash his way through the competition. A skilled pilot in his own right, he nonetheless opted to install various illegal weapons on his podracer, such as a flamethrower built into the left engine, to ensure his victories on the track. The crowd favorite of a course known as the Boonta Eve Classic, located on the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine, Sebulba maintained a strong rivalry with one of podracings few human participants, a young boy named Anakin Skywalker. A short while after the Invasion of Naboo, Sebulba and Skywalker competed in a Boonta race together.

Early in the race, Sebulba bested the competitor Mawhonic, before snuffing out more pilots during the second lap. After several more close calls, Sebulba and Skywalker eventually raced into the third lap neck and neck. The Dug nearly dispatched Skywalker near the end of the lap, but the Human regained his ground. The two continued the battle for first place until Sebulba crashed into the desert sands after his cockpit got tangled with Skywalker's engines. The wreck paved the way to victory lane for Skywalker, which earned the boy his freedom from slavery. Sebulba survived his wreck and continued to race into the Clone Wars. Sometime later Sebulba abandoned podracing and began a career in battle-racing."
Quarsh Panaka,brown,male,,"Quarsh Panaka was a Human male who served as the head of the Royal Naboo Security Forces before, during, and after the Invasion of Naboo, and later was the Moff for the Chommell sector during the Galactic Civil War. He was a vocal militarist among the peaceful people of Naboo, a fish out of water amongst his peers. Shaken by the murder of King Ars Veruna, he installed various security measures to make sure that the same thing did not happen to his second monarch, Queen Padmé Amidala. By learning from the mistakes of his predecessor, Maris Magneta, he was able to successfully defend her in several periods of danger, and continued to serve Naboo, the Republic, and eventually, the Empire.

Notoriously conservative, Panaka often clashed with the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn during the Invasion of Naboo, deriding the Jedi's controversial methods and retaining the utmost faith in his own. Nevertheless, with Jinn's help he was able to get his chance at military action, in the Battle of Naboo. Panaka thereafter became a staunch supporter of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and the New Order of the Galactic Empire, rising to the position of Moff of his home sector with Palpatine's patronage."
Shmi Skywalker,brown,female,Human,"Shmi Skywalker Lars, formerly known as Shmi Skywalker, was a human female who lived in slavery on the planet Tatooine during the last years of the Galactic Republic. During her time as a slave, she gave birth to a child called Anakin Skywalker. In 32 BBY her son was discovered by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, who found the boy to be unusually strong with the Force. He learned through Shmi that there was no father involved in Anakin's conception, leading Jinn to believe that Anakin was conceived by the midi-chlorians. With Shmi's support, Anakin was taken by Jinn to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and presented to the leaders of the Jedi Order as the Chosen Onethe one who was destined to restore balance to the Force, according to Jedi prophecy.

After Anakin left Tatooine to begin his Jedi training, Shmi married Cliegg Larsa moisture farmer who freed her from slaveryand became a loving stepmother to his son, Owen Lars. Her chance to see Anakin one last time came when, in the waning days of the Separatist Crisis, Shmi was abducted and subjected to torture by a group of Tusken Raiders in 22 BBY. By then, her son had returned to Tatooine as a Jedi Padawan. Having seen her son again, Shmi told him she was complete but died in his arms. Unable to prevent his mother's demise, Anakin gave into the dark side of the Force and massacred the Tusken Raiders, including their women and children, and buried his mother at the Lars moisture farm. Shortly after Shmi's death, her son went on to become a Jedi Knight, as well as a general in the Grand Army of the Republic during the galaxy-wide conflict known as the Clone Wars. The loss of his mother also pushed him to desire the ability to save his loved ones from death, which ultimately pushed Skywalker to become Darth Sidious's Sith apprentice."
Darth Maul,yellow,male,Zabrak,"Maul, once known as Darth Maul, was a Force-sensitive Dathomirian Zabrak male who established himself as a crime lord during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Once, however, he was the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and deadly skilled in lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return to power despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.

Born during the era of the Galactic Republic, Maul was the son of Mother Talzin, leader of the Nightsisters of Dathomir, and also had a sibling, the Nightbrother Savage Opress. Sensing Maul's potential, Sidious took Talzin's son as an apprentice while he was still a child. Anointed by his Sith Master as Darth Maul, the Dathomirian was raised to hate the Jedi Knights that served the light side of the Force. Desiring to see the Jedi Order fall, Maul trained for the day when the Sith would exact revenge on their ancient foes. The time for revealing the Sith's continued existence to the Jedi came during the Invasion of Naboo, when Maul confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though he killed Jinn, Maul was, in turn, defeated by Kenobi, who bisected the Sith assassin at the waist. He was believed to be dead in the aftermath of the battle, but Maul ultimately survived, emerging a decade after his defeat at the height of the Clone Wars.

Despite learning that his Master took a new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, Maul still believed that he was a Sith Lord. Taking his brother as an apprentice, Maul and Opress held that they were the true Sith rather than Sidious and Tyranus. He then devised a scheme to seize power on the planet Mandalore, overthrowing the New Mandalorians and installing the Death Watch as the new ruling government. In addition to the Mandalorians, Maul expanded his criminal enterprise, the Shadow Collective, to include the Pyke Syndicate, Black Sun, and the Hutt Clan. However, as his power increased, Maul became a threat to his former Master's plan, resulting in a confrontation that concluded with Opress's demise and Maul's capture by Sidious. After escaping with the help of his Mandalorian super commandos, Maul resumed his reign on Mandalore until he was overthrown by the Grand Army of the Republic.

Maul survived the end of the Clone Wars, witnessing the Great Jedi Purge of Order 66 and Sidious's rise as Galactic Emperor. Chastened by his former Master on the principle of the Rule of Two, Maul abandoned his claim to the mantle of the Sith, focusing instead on building an empire of his ownthe Crimson Dawnby controlling the criminal underworld. Ultimately though, Maul remained driven by the desire for revenge, specifically against Sidious, the Master who disowned him, and Kenobi, the Jedi who defeated him. During his conflict with the Jedi fugitives Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, Maul tracked Kenobi to Tatooine, determined to finally end their rivalry for good. Their last lightsaber duel ended when the Jedi Master struck down his old nemesis. Believing that Kenobi had consigned himself to a life of exile to protect the Chosen One, Maul died taking comfort in the belief that he would be avenged once the Sith's prophesied destruction was realized."
Bib Fortuna,pink,male,Twi'lek,"Bib Fortuna was a male Twi'lek who lived on the desert planet Tatooine. He served as Jabba the Hutt's majordomo and chief of staff for decades, handling all of the day-to-day operations at his master's palace.
A male Twi'lek, Bib Fortuna hailed from Ryloth, the homeworld of his species. He had at least one cousin, Beezer. At some point, Fortuna competed against Bidlo Kwerve to become the majordomo of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. Fortuna also gave Jabba his pet rancor Pateesaas a birthday present. Ultimately, Fortuna succeeded and claimed the job whereas Kwerve ended up as an early victim of the rancor.
He served as Jabba's majordomo as far back as the time of the Invasion of Naboo, in 32 BBY. That year, Fortuna attended the Boonta Eve Classic, which his master hosted to commemorate the Boonta Eve holiday. From his master's private balcony, he witnessed the victory of a local human boy named Anakin Skywalker against the reigning champion Sebulba.

"
Ayla Secura,hazel,female,Twi'lek,"Aayla Secura, a Force-sensitive Rutian Twi'lek female, was a Jedi Master who served as a Jedi General of the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Prior to the Clone Wars, Secura learned the ways of the Force as the Padawan of Jedi Master Quinlan Vos. With the outbreak of civil war between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Secura and her fellow Jedi supported the Republic by becoming officers in its newly-formed military. As a general, she commanded the clone troopers of the 327th Star Corps, with Commander CC-5052 ""Bly"" serving at Secura's side.

Throughout the conflict, Secura fought alongside her soldiers in multiple battles across the galaxy, from Geonosis to Quell, Coruscant, and Felucia. As the war drew to an end, the clones were instructed by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to execute Order 66, resulting in a sudden purge of the Jedi Order at the hands of their own troopers. As a result, Secura was among the first casualties of the purge, having been shot in the back repeatedly by Bly and several other clone troopers.

The demise of Secura and many other Jedi was sensed through the Force by Grand Master Yoda, who survived the purge and ultimately escaped into exile, while the Galactic Empire rose to power in place of the Republic. Secura's death was also witnessed in a Force vision by Depa Billaba and her apprentice, Caleb Dume, on Kaller."
Dud Bolt,yellow,male,Vulptereen,"Dud Bolt was a Vulptereen male hit man and professional Podracer pilot during the waning years of the Galactic Republic. With a battered and scarred Vulptereen 327 Podracer at his disposal, Bolt maintained an aggressive on-course reputation. However, unbeknownst to most, the Vulptereen was employed as a mid-air bodyguard by the notorious Dug pilot and cheat Sebulba.

A competent pilot nevertheless, Bolt scored various race records on the planets of Malastare, Gamorr, Mon Calamari, and Sullust, and was even considered to be the crowd favorite for the Malastare 100 and a second Malastare based course. Bolt had also participated in the Boonta Eve Classic on the desert planet Tatooine at one point, andalongside Sebulbalater returned to the event again during the year 32 BBY. Shortly before the race, Bolt aided Sebulba in sabotaging the Podracer of rival pilot Mars Guo.

Despite Bolt's and Sebulba's attempts at cheating, neither pilot finished the Boonta, with Bolt colliding into the Nuknog pilot Ark Roose. By the 24 BBY Podracing season, the Glymphid Aldar Beedo replaced Bolt as Sebulba's bodyguard, with both pilots subsequently earning crosshairs on their heads from a vengeful Bolt. The Vulptereen's career continued through 22 BBY, at which point he had furthered his fame to the planet Utapau and made enemies out pilot Clegg Holdfast and the crew of Team Watto."
Gasgano,black,male,Xexto,"A Xexto male, Gasgano performed as a professional podracer pilot, flying a green Ord Pedrovia podracer. Gasgano raced for high-speed thrills, and his four spindly arms made him perfectly suited for racing, able to use all of his arms at once to pilot his pod. Extremely competitive, he disliked the prospect of losing, and joined the Boonta Eve Classic podrace on the desert planet Tatooine, which took place ten years prior to the intergalactic Clone Wars, in order to beat the local champion, the Dug Sebulba. Gasgano's competition also included two-time Boonta winner Boles Roor, returning Boonta competitor Dud Bolt, and the Er'Kit Ody Mandrell, who employed a team of record setting pit droids. Gasgano also had it in his mind to beat the human competitor Anakin Skywalker. The Boonta was held at the Mos Espa Grand Arena, and the Ord Pedrovia was placed in the middle of the third role, next to Roor's podracer, and directly behind Bolt's and Skywalker's racers.
The Troig race announcer Beed, speaking in Huttese, introduced Gasgano and his podracer shortly before the race's host, Jabba the Hutt, announced the official start of the race. The podracers darted off with the exception of two: Skywalker and Ben Quadinaros, both having stalled. It wasn't long before Gasgano was behind the leaders, having overtaken Mandrell, Roor, Bolt, and several other racers. Eventually, Skywalker repaired his podracer and entered the course, and overtook the pilots behind Gasgano. The crafty Xexto attempted to block Skywalker's attempts at passing, but was bested when the Human flew over the Ord Pedrovia following a cliff drop. Gasgano attempted to retake lost ground, and briefly overtook Skywalker after the Human lost a scuffle to Sebulba. However, the lead over Skywalker didn't last long, and Gasgano was trapped behind the two leaders. During the final stretch of the third lap, Sebulba crashed after a second tangle with Skywalker, allowing Gasgano to gain ground and beat at least one more competitor, albeit his last. Ultimately, Skywalker won the Boonta. Gasgano finished in second place."
Ben Quadinaros,orange,male,Toong,"Ben Quadinaros was a Toong podracer pilot who had very little actual racing experience when he participated in the Boonta Eve Classic that saw the liberation of the slave boy Anakin Skywalker. Piloting a BT310 quadra-Podracer, Quadinaros never left the starting grid due to his pod stalling. A short while later, his power coupling failed, causing his engine's energy binders to deactivate. This caused the hapless Toong's engines to spiral away from the cockpit and fly off and explode on various parts of the Mos Espa Grand Arena. Despite this loss, Quadinaros continued to podrace up to ten years later, during the time of the Clone Wars."
Mace Windu,brown,male,Human,"Mace Windu, a Force-sensitive human male, was a revered Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. During his time in the Jedi Order, he once served as elected leader of the Jedi and, during the Clone Wars, as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. He was the greatest champion of the Jedi Order and promoted its ancient traditions amidst the growing influence of the dark side of the Force in the corrupt, declining days of the Republic.

When the Separatist Crisis spawned the birth of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and sparked the Clone Wars, Windu and the Jedi rallied to the defense of the Republic and became the leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic. Throughout the war, Windu served the Jedi and the Republic in various capacitieson the battlefield in command of the clone army, on Coruscant as an overseer of the war effort and an advisor to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, and even as a diplomat to contested worlds, despite his disdain of politics. His exploits on the frontline served as a reminder of his reputation as a renowned Jedi warrior.

As the war drew to a close, Windu became increasingly suspicious of the chancellor's motives, as Palpatine had amassed near-dictatorial control over the Galactic Senate, and sensed the rising power of the dark side in the galaxy. His suspicions were confirmed when Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight and the Chosen One of ancient prophecy, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who manipulated the Republic and the Separatist Alliance into war. Windu, along with Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, confronted Palpatine with the intention of arresting him. Instead, the Dark Lord attacked them, striking them down one by one until only Windu was left. Windu bested Palpatine in the confrontation anddeciding the chancellor was too dangerous to be left alive due to his influence over the governmentprepared to strike him down, but the intervention of Anakin Skywalker, who saved the chancellor's life, led to Windu's death. As a result, Skywalker fell to the temptation of the dark side and was renamed Darth Vader.

Windu's actions led Palpatine to brand the Jedi as traitors to the Republic. The chancellor executed Order 66 and clone troopers across the galaxy turned against and killed their Jedi leaders, marking the fall of the Jedi Order. Palpatine transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire and the Emperor's new regime promoted anti-Jedi sentiment across the galaxy. Through propaganda, the Empire portrayed Windu as the leader of a criminal gang of Jedi who caused the outbreak of the Clone Wars. In spite of the propaganda, some of Windu's actions were remembered with fondness; General Cham Syndulla, who served alongside Windu during the Battle of Ryloth, remembered Windu with great respect and told the tale of how Windu helped him liberate Ryloth during the war."
Ki-Adi-Mundi,yellow,male,Cerean,"Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Force-sensitive male Cerean Jedi Master of the Jedi Order who served on the High Council in the twilight years of the Galactic Republic and played a major role in several battles during the Clone Wars. Born in 92 BBY, Mundi was discovered at age four by the Jedi An'ya Kuro and became one of the few permitted by the Jedi Order to be trained starting beyond infancy. After more than two decades as a Padawan to Master Yoda, Mundi was named a Jedi Knight and returned to Cerea to liberate his home village from a gang of raiders. Assigned the Jedi Watchman of the Cerean sector, Mundi was granted a rare exception to the Jedi Order's ban on marriage due to his species' low birth rate and had a polygamous family of five wives and seven children, although he tried to avoid developing emotional attachments to them.

Like many Cereans of his generation, Mundi favored his home world's isolation from the galaxy, speaking out against off-worlder technology and encouraging Cerea to maintain their independence from the Republic. Mundi was held in high regard by members of the Jedi High Council, on which he occasionally sat in during the absence of Master Micah Giiett. He was eventually offered a permanent seat on the Council despite not yet having obtained the rank of Jedi Master. Before accepting, Mundi rescued his daughter Sylvn from the captivity of an agent of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and in doing so uncovered a secret Cerean smuggling ring and illegal Trade Federation activities. Shortly after formally joining the Council in 33 BBY, Mundi was sent to seek the lost Jedi Sharad Hett on Tatooine. Following Hett's death, Mundi agreed to continue the Jedi training of his son, A'Sharad Hett.

While Mundi and Hett grew close, the Cerean eventually agreed to turn his training over to Kuro after Hett felt tempted by the dark side of the Force during a lightsaber duel with bounty hunter Aurra Sing. As the Confederacy of Independent Systems uprising threatened the stability of the Republic, Mundi was among the Jedi dispatched to Geonosis in 22 BBY to confront the Separatist Droid Army, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars. Now a Jedi General commanding the Galactic Marines branch of the Grand Army of the Republic, Mundi participated in several major battles, including the battle of Hypori, where he barely survived a lightsaber duel against General Grievous. Mundi's entire family was killed during the Battle of Cerea, but the Jedi overcame his grief by further committing to his Jedi duties. He briefly assumed the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker following Obi-Wan Kenobi's presumed death.

Mundi also dueled the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress on Coruscant after exposing a spy from within the Galactic Senate working with her. Along with Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, Mundi led an assault against several Separatist battle droid foundries on Geonosis. Following the assault Mundi earned the ""everlasting respect"" of Anakin Skywalker, as Mundi killed a total of 65 droids and Geonosians during the assault. As the Clone Wars approached conclusion, Mundi suggested to the Jedi High Council that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine may have become too powerful and that the Jedi Order might need to assume control of the Republic for an interim period until a transition of power could commence. Mundi was leading the Galactic Marines to battle on Mygeeto in 19 BBY when Palpatine began the Great Jedi Purge with Order 66, resulting in Mundi being shot to death by his own clone troopers."
Kit Fisto,black,male,Nautolan,"Kit Fisto was a Nautolan Jedi Master during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Fisto was known as an expert swordsman, having some of the finest dueling skills in the Jedi Order. A celebrated fighter, Fisto served the Republic as a general for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems. Fisto fought in various campaigns and over the course of the war was accepted as a member of the Jedi High Council.

Fisto took part in several battles during the early stages of the war, first serving in the opening conflict of the war on Geonosis and shortly thereafter in a covert operation on the planet Hissrich. Following the escape of Separatist leader Nute Gunray from Republic custody, Fisto and his former padawan, Nahdar Vebb, were tasked with tracking down the fugitive. Their mission went awry, however, as they instead ended up facing the notorious Jedi hunter and Separatist General Grievous in his lair. While Vebb perished at the hands of the General, Fisto very nearly bested him in combat, and escaped with his life, but without Gunray, ultimately making the mission a failure.

During a schism between the Mon Calamari and Quarren peoples on Mon Cala, Fisto was sent to aid the Mon Calamari against the Separatist-backed Quarren. The battle proved to be difficult, as the Separatists eventually overpowered the Republic forces. With a Separatist victory looming, Fisto and several others escaped into hiding, though he was eventually captured and tortured. The Mon Calamari and Quarren later rekindled their alliance and repelled the Separatists, aided by the freed Fisto. Following the Mon Cala campaign, Fisto took a more active role on the High Council. As the end of the war drew near, Anakin Skywalker revealed to Mace Windu that Chancellor Palpatine was a Sith Lord. Windu took Fisto and fellow Masters Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin to Palpatine's office to arrest him. The Dark Lord easily killed Kolar, Tiin, and Fisto within a matter of seconds, with Windu joining them soon after."
Eeth Koth,brown,male,Zabrak,"Eeth Koth was a male Zabrak Jedi Master, and member of the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Iridonian Zabrak such as Eeth Koth were renowned for their mental discipline, which allowed them to tolerate great physical suffering. This ability was born of surviving their harsh environment. Koth was born in the violent slums of Nar Shaddaa, and was deemed too old to begin Jedi training at age four.

His natural abilities were his ticket into the Jedi Order, and Koth would go on to become a leading member of the Jedi Council. Koth participated in the Battle of Geonosis, the opening battle of the Clone Wars, as part of the Geonosis strike team consisting of 212 Jedi. Koth narrowly survived a LAAT gunship crash which took the life of Tarados Gon, and was initially believed to be dead following the battle. After returning to his duties, Koth would go on to lead his men in the Battle of Korriban. A chance encounter with the General of the Separatist Droid Army, Grievous, led to his capture in the Outer Rim. However, using sign language hidden in a holotransmission sent to the Jedi Council by Grievous, Koth led the Republic Navy to his location over Saleucami, where Anakin Skywalker and Adi Gallia freed Koth from his imprisonment, though not without escaping a trap by Grievous."
Adi Gallia,blue,female,Tholothian,"Adi Gallia was a female Tholothian Jedi Master during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic. Gallia was a respected member of the Jedi High Council, who served on that august body in the years leading up to the Clone Wars, as well as some time into that devastating conflict. Though the daughter of Corellian parents, Master Gallia was notable for wearing a traditional Tholoth headdress, suggesting she had ancestors from the planet Tholoth.

As a revered Jedi Master of the High Council, Gallia was naturally an exceptionally skilled member of the Order, who completed several notable assignments during her service to the galaxy. Gallia was a key player in the Stark Hyperspace War and served as the chief negotiator during talks aimed at mending ties between warring factions on Malastare. Gallia also participated in the opening battle of the Clone Wars, where her actions saved countless lives.

Despite her undoubted skill in combat, Master Gallia eventually fell to the blade of Nightbrother Savage Opress while fighting alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi on Florrum in 20 BBY. Kenobi would manage to partially avenge Gallia by using her lightsaber to sever Opress's left arm. She was succeeded on the Jedi Council by her cousin, Stass Allie."
Saesee Tiin,orange,male,Iktotchi,"Saesee Tiin was a male Iktotchi Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi High Council in the last days of the Galactic Republic. Having apprenticed under the esteemed Jedi Master Omo Bouri, Tiin rarely spoke and kept to himself. Never choosing to take a Padawan himself, Tiin took the rank of Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.

Tiin fought in the Stark Hyperspace War in 44 BBY during the fifth battle on Qotile and also participated in the Yinchorri Uprising of 33 BBY. Some time after that, he and other Jedi tracked down the terrorist Nebula Front movement to their base on Asmeru. Tiin fought on many battlefronts during the Clone Wars on planets such as Lola Sayu, Gwori, Boz Pity, Diado, Geonosis, and The Rig.

A renowned starfighter ace, Tiin had been born on Iktotch, the moon of Iktotchon. Because of the battering winds of the moon, Tiin's species had adapted toughened skin and blunt features. Tiin was a starfighter instructor for younglings, where he taught many younglings the basics of flying. A natural telepath, Master Tiin failed to foresee his demise at the hands of the secret Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who in reality, was Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Galactic Republic. Tiin's death on Coruscant in 19 BBY alongside that of Mace Windu, Kit Fisto and Agen Kolar to Darth Sidious marked the start of the Great Jedi Purge and Order 66."
Yarael Poof,yellow,male,Quermian,"Yarael Poof was a male Quermian Jedi Master and revered member of the Jedi High Council in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. Rather mischievous in his use of the Force, Master Poof was a consummate practitioner of the Affect Mind ability, thus limiting his need to wield his lightsaber.
Sitting on the High Council for years, Poof sacrificed his life in 27 BBY when he drew in the deadly powers of the Infant of Shaa to protect the citizens of Coruscant. His body rejoined the Force through cremation at the Jedi Temple's pyre.
As a Quermian, Poof's unusually long legs, body, and neck caused him to stand some three feet taller than other humanoid species. In addition to his upper arms, Poof had an additional set of delicate arms which he hid under his cloak. Possessing remarkable dexterity because of the extra set of limbs, Poof's sensitive olfactory glands were located in his hands. He had two brains, one located inside his skull and the other in his chest cavity. Out of the four Quermian Jedi enrolled in the Order at the time of the Invasion of Naboo, Poof was the most senior."
Plo Koon,black,male,Kel Dor,"Plo Koon was a Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion.

Koon was a survivor of the First Battle of Geonosis, the opening salvo of the Clone Wars that claimed the lives nearly 200 Jedi. Early in the war he embarked on a mission to track down the Separatist warship Malevolence. Following several attempts to destroy the weapon, Koon and several of his peers managed to take it down. Among the Jedi he often worked with was Ahsoka Tano, whom he had discovered years before the war and shared a special bond with. During the war he played vital roles in the First and Second battles of Felucia, the Battle of Lola Sayu, and the Battle of Kadavo. As the conflict thickened, Ahsoka was framed for a terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple and was subsequently removed from the Jedi Order. When the true culprit was discovered, Koon and the Council offered her a chance to rejoin, but she refused and left the Jedi.

In the late stages of the Clone Wars, Koon led the 442nd Siege Battalion in the Battle of Cato Neimoidia. As he and a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters flew over the bridge cities following their victory, he was shot down and executed by his troops during the issuance of Order 66, during which the Jedi were massacred across the galaxy by their soldiers."
Mas Amedda,blue,male,Chagrian,"Mas Amedda was a Chagrian male politician who served as the nominal leader of the Coruscant provisional government in the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War. During the Republic Era, he served as Vice Chair of the Galactic Senate from the chancellery of Finis Valorum to Sheev Palpatine. Amedda became the Grand Vizier of the Galactic Empire after Palpatine declared himself Galactic Emperor.

Amedda was from the planet Champala. He lived on the Core World Coruscant, capital of the Galactic Republic, where he served in Chancellor Valorum's government as Vice Chair. During the Invasion of Naboo in 32 BBY, Queen Padmé Amidala traveled to the galactic capital seeking Republic intervention against the Trade Federation's occupation of her homeworld. Although Valorum was removed from office by a Vote of No Confidence, Amedda retained his position under Palpatine, the senator of Naboo who was elected as the new Supreme Chancellor. He served as one of Palpatine's advisors during the Separatist Crisis; when Amedda recommended giving emergency powers to the Chancellor, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks successfully proposed the motion to the Senate, allowing Palpatine to organize legions of clone troopers from Kamino into the Grand Army of the Republic in 22 BBY.

Amedda continued to serve in the Office of the Chancellor during the Clone Wars, supporting Palpatine's decisions as a wartime leader. With the execution of Order 66 against the Jedi Order, Amedda witnessed the ascension of Palpatinethe Sith Lord Darth Sidiousas Emperor of the galaxy in 19 BBY. Amedda retained his power in the New Order, serving as Grand Vizier in the Imperial Ruling Council. After the Emperor was killed in 4 ABY, Amedda was forced to serve as a figurehead for Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-styled Counselor to the Empire. Following the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, Amedda surrendered the Empire to the New Republic by signing the Galactic Concordance. The Imperial government on Coruscant was replaced by a powerless provisional government with Amedda as its nominal leader. Amedda was remembered by history as a weak-willed sycophant of the Emperor."
Gregar Typho,brown,male,Human,"Captain Gregar Typho was a Human male who served as head of security for Senator Padmé Amidala during the Separatist Crisis and Clone Wars. A quiet, simple man native to the backwater world of Naboo, Typho made a name for himself as a Junior Palace Guard during the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY, in which he fought with distinction, suffering several injuries including the loss of his left eye. Typho then became the personal bodyguard and security advisor for Padmé Amidala in 24 BBY when she abdicated the throne and became a Senator; he inherited the position from his uncle, Quarsh Panaka, who served as Typho's mentor for much of his life. Typho quickly fell in love with the Senator, but he knew their social castes were too different for any relationship to form. When Amidala's life came under threat in 22 BBY, Typho's paranoia of an assassination attempt coinciding with the Senator's visit to Coruscant to vote on the Military Creation Act saved her life, when a decoy handmaiden was killed in her place. Typho continued to serve Amidala during the Clone Wars, traveling on several diplomatic missions for her.

In 19 BBY, Amidala went to Mustafar to find her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalkerand never returned. A mourning Typho attended her funeral, feeling guilty for having let her go to Mustafar in the first place. He ultimately decided to travel to Coruscant to find her killer and avenge Amidala's death, but it was months before he could get leave from his duties. During this time, he worked with former Jedi Ferus Olin against the Empire on Naboo. A year after the Declaration of a New Order, Typho finally made it to Coruscant, and eventually came to the conclusion that Amidala had been ""killed"" by Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. Typho lured Vader into a trap and tried to kill him, but the Sith's command of the Force was too strong for him, and Vader killed Captain Typho."
Cordé,brown,female,Human,"Cordé was a Human female handmaiden and decoy for Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo during the end of the Separatist Crisis.
While Amidala was Queen of Naboo, the role of decoy was mainly filled by Sabé. Cordé replaced her when Amidala stepped down from the throne and became the Senatorial representative of the Chommell sector. Like Sabé, Cordé worked closely with Padmé, and the two women became close friends.
In 22 BBY, Cordé was killed in an assassination attempt on Amidala when the Senator returned to Coruscant for the Senate vote on the Military Creation Act. A Clawdite bounty hunter named Zam Wesell was responsible for the attack. One of Amidala's other handmaidens, Versé, and five Naboo guards were also killed in the blast.
Cordé died apologizing to Amidala, disheartened in thinking she had failed her duty to her mistress. On the contrary, the Senator was heartbroken by Cordé's sacrifice, regrettably accepting that she had performed her duty. At Captain Typho's insistence, Amidala reluctantly left the bodies of Cordé and the other victims behind, promising herself that their sacrifice would not be in vain."
Cliegg Lars,blue,male,Human,"Cliegg Lars was a human male moisture farmer from Tatooine. He had one son, Owen Lars, from his first marriage. In the years prior to the Clone Wars, he met Shmi Skywalker and freed her from slavery before marrying her. As such, he was the step-father of Anakin Skywalker, and the step-grandfather of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.

Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Shmi was captured by a band of Tusken Raiders. Lars and a number of other moisture farmers attempted to save her, but the sand people drove them back, and Lars lost his right leg as a result. Anakin Skywalker later arrived on Tatooine, having had visions through the Force of Shmi's suffering and met Lars. Skywalker found his mother, but she died in his arms and he returned her body to the Lars moisture farm for burial, where Lars said goodbye to his wife before dying sometime later."
Poggle the Lesser,yellow,male,Geonosian,"Archduke Poggle the Lesser was the public leader of the Geonosians during the Clone Wars. Though subservient to Queen Karina the Great, he was nominally in control of the Stalgasin hive, and with his oversight of the Geonosian Baktoid battle droid factories, became a powerful figure within the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Archduke was a warlord, and commanded the droid armies that fought against the Republic during the first and second battles of Geonosis, the latter of which he was captured and brought into Republic custody. Incarcerated for two years on Coruscant, he was later recruited by the Republic Special Weapons Group to assist in the construction of the Ultimate Weapon battlestation the Geonosians designed; however, later absconded to Confederate space after sabotaging the project. During the final stages of the war, he and the rest of the Separatist Council were relocated to Utapau and later on Mustafar, where he was killed by Darth Vader."
Luminara Unduli,blue,female,Mirialan,"Luminara Unduli was a Force-sensitive Mirialan female Jedi Master during the final days of the Jedi Order. She commanded the 41st Elite Corps of the Grand Army of the Republic, and was the master of Padawan Barriss Offee. Together, they fought in numerous battlefields of the Clone Wars, before Offee turned against the Jedi Order and bombed the Jedi Temple.

At the end of the war, Unduli fought in the battle on Kashyyyk. She was arrested and executed after Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine issued Order 66 and destroyed the Jedi Order. The Galactic Empire would later use her remains to attract and kill any Jedi that survived Order 66. One such trap was laid for Kanan Jarrus and the crew of the Ghost, who believed Unduli was alive and being imprisoned on Stygeon Prime. They mounted a rescue mission, only to discover that it was a trap by the Grand Inquisitor. The rebels escaped with the knowledge that Unduli was dead and spread the word to dispel the ruse, preventing any more deaths in her name."
Barriss Offee,blue,female,Mirialan,"Barriss Offee was a Force-sensitive female Mirialan who trained as a Jedi Padawan during the Clone Wars. She carried a blue lightsaber and trained under Jedi Master Luminara Unduli. Offee participated in the First Battle of Geonosis that began the Clone Wars and continued to serve alognside Unduli throughout the war. Offee preferred studying ancient Jedi texts to fighting. During her time as a Jedi Padawan, Offee struck up a friendship with Ahsoka Tano, the Padawan learner of Anakin Skywalker. Though rather different in personality, the two bonded through shared experience in combat, inluding at the Second Battle of Geonosis.

As the Clone Wars continued, Offee grew disillusioned with the Jedi's role in the wars, believing they had lost their way from the ideals that the Jedi Order was supposed to represent, and wary of the Jedi Council in particular. Deciding to act on her concerns, she orchestrated the bombing of the Jedi Temple as a means to foment further distrust of the Jedi. Despite their previous friendship, she allowed Tano to be framed for orchestrating the bombing, but ultimately confessed after being confronted by Anakin Skywalker, just before Tano was about to be convicted of the crime, even going as far to impersonate former Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress to frame her former friend. However, Tano's master, Anakin Skywalker, ended up catching Offee and bringing her to justice, clearing his Padawan's name. Offee expressed her views of the Jedi Order in front of the tribunal, showing that she had been corrupted by the dark side before being taken away."
Dormé,brown,female,Human,"Dormé was a Human female from Naboo and one of the most devoted handmaidens of Padmé Amidala during the former Queen's time as the Senatorial representative of the Chommell sector in the Galactic Senate.
While on Coruscant with Padmé Amidala in the leadup to voting on the Military Creation Act, Dormé noticed the growing affection between the Senator and the Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker as she watched from the sidelines.
When Senator Amidala was forced to flee the Galactic Republic capital with Skywalker and R2-D2, Dormé remained behind, along with Captain Gregar Typho, in order to maintain the illusion that Padmé was still on the planet and thus throw off further assassination attempts.
Though fellow handmaidens Cordé and Versé had perished during an earlier attempt on the Senator's life, Dormé was willing to put her duty before her own safety in order to act as a decoy for the former monarch during the last days of peace before the beginning of the Clone Wars."
Dooku,brown,male,Human,"Dooku, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Master that fell to the dark side of the Force and became the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Tyranus during the final years of the Galactic Republic. After leaving the Jedi Order, he claimed the title Count of Serenno and, during the Clone Wars, served as Head of State of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He was the second apprentice of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith whose plan to conquer the galaxy relied on Dooku leading a pan-galactic secessionist movement against the Republic. As such, Dooku immersed himself in the dark side and worked tirelessly to advance his master's plans, but ultimately forgot that treachery was the way of the Sith.

Born in 102 BBY during the Age of the Republic, Dooku was taken by the Jedi Order after being abandoned by his family and learned the Jedi arts as the Padawan of Yoda, the legendary Grand Master of the Jedi Order. A political idealist, the corruption in the Galactic Senateas well as the traditions of the Jedidisillusioned him, causing Dooku to voluntarily leave the Order and return to his homeworld where he reclaimed his title and heritage as a nobleman. His former peers believed his decision was misguided but still held him in high esteem. Unknown to the Jedi, however, Dooku not only renounced their ways but his commitment to the light side of the Force as well. Having sworn his allegiance to Darth Sidious, Dooku became the Dark Lord's apprentice and adopted the secret name of Darth Tyranus. Throughout the first decade of Sheev Palpatine's chancellery, Dooku used his resources and charisma to recruit entire star systems to the Separatist cause. At the same time, he oversaw the development of two vast armies that would be pitted against each other in the conflict to come: the Separatist Droid Army, which consisted entirely of battle droids manufactured on Geonosis; and the Grand Army of the Republic, composed by clone troopers bred on Kamino and modeled on the bounty hunter Jango Fett.

After years of maneuvering the galaxy into a state of war, the Clone Wars began when the newly formed Republic Military invaded Geonosis in 22 BBY. As leader of the Separatists, Dooku delegated military authority to a cadre of subordinates personally trained by himself, including General Grievous and Asajj Ventress. While Grievous was trained only in the art of lightsaber combat, Ventress was strong with the Force, affording her the opportunity to learn the ways of the dark side from Dooku. The Sith, however, remained faithful to Darth Bane's Rule of Two; and as such, Dooku was compelled to betray his disciple after Sidious became suspicious of his own apprentice's intentions. Though he sought to replace Ventress with Savage Opress and later Quinlan Vos, Dooku ultimately remained beholden to his master's will. By the third year of the war, Dooku and Grievous succeeded in abducting Chancellor Palpatine from the Republic capital of Coruscant in 19 BBY. During the ensuing Battle of Coruscant, he was confronted and defeated by the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who summarily executed the Count via beheading at the Chancellor's behest. In the days following Dooku's death, Palpatine revealed to the Jedi that he was, in fact, Darth Sidious, who betrayed his apprentice in order to replace him with Skywalker. With the subsequent fall of the Jedi Order, Sidious consolidated his power upon declaring himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire. As for Skywalker, he succeeded the late Darth Tyranus as Sidious's third and last apprentice, resulting in his transformation into Darth Vader and proving his slain victim's words of sensing fear, hate and anger."
Bail Prestor Organa,brown,male,Human,"Bail Organa was a human male Alderaanian politician, an influential voice for peace in the Galactic Senate during the last days of the Galactic Republic, and a founding member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Organa, the senator of Alderaan, was an outspoken member of the Senate's Loyalist Committee that pushed to maintain the ideals of the Republic during the Clone Wars. He became an architect of the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and believed that a full-scale Galactic Civil War was inevitable if the Empire was to be toppled and replaced by a New Republic.

During the Clone Wars, Organa often worked closely with Senators Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila in an attempt to de-escalate the war with the Confederacy of Independent Systems and bring about a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the years-long conflict. He was an opponent of the Republic military enhancement bill that increased the production of clone troopers for the Grand Army of the Republic, as well as the architect of the Alderaan Refugee Conference to deal with the refugees displaced by the war with the Separatist Alliance. At times he became caught in the action of the war, including when his relief effort on Christophsis fell under Separatist siege shortly before the Battle of Christophsis. He also ensured that relief supplies could be delivered to the citizens of Ryloth during the Separatist occupation of the planet.

After the transformation of the Republic into the Empire, Organa continued to serve in the Imperial Senate but quietly began organizing a rebel movement to combat the Empire. He and his wife, Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan, secretly adopted Leia Organa, who came into their care after her mother, Senator Amidala, died and her husband, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, fell to the dark side of the Force. Princess Leia followed in her father's footsteps and succeeded him in the Senate while quietly supporting the Rebel Alliance. Organa tasked her with finding Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, his old friend and ally, in exile on Tatooine and bringing him into the fight. Bail then returned home to Alderaan to inform his people that war was coming, a warning that would come too late. Shortly thereafter, Organa and the queen were killed when the Death Star, an Imperial superweapon, destroyed Alderaan. They were remembered fondly by the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic as revolutionaries who fought to restore peace and freedom in the galaxy."
Jango Fett,brown,male,Human,"Jango Fett was a human male bounty hunter and the clone template of the Grand Army of the Republic. Considered the best in his profession during the final years of the Galactic Republic, Fett was proficient in marksmanship as well as unarmed combat. The Mandalorian armor that he wore featured various weapons and gadgets, including a flamethrower, dual WESTAR-34 blaster pistols and a jetpack. His personal starship was the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I.

Though allegedly from the planet Concord Dawn, Fett was not Mandalorian but a common mercenary according to the government of Mandalore. Prior to the Clone Wars, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus hired Fett to serve as the genetic foundation of an army secretly bred on the extragalactic world of Kamino. His DNA spawned millions of clone troopers who shared his face, voice, and were trained to become soldiers. As part of his payment, Fett was given an unaltered clone whom he raised as his son, Boba Fett. In the last days of the Separatist Crisis, Fett was involved in the failed plot to assassinate Senator Padmé Amidala on Coruscant. The Jedi Order investigated the incident, forcing Fett to leave the Kaminoan homeworld after he was confronted by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Kenobi tracked Fett to Geonosis where he discovered the bounty hunter's connection with Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Fett fought against the Jedi assault team during the First Battle of Geonosis, and was killed by Jedi Master Mace Windu in 22 BBY. His legacy survived not only through the millions of clone troopers that formed the backbone of the Republic Military, but also Boba, who became a bounty hunter like his father before him. By the era of the Galactic Empire, Boba possessed his own Mandalorian armor that was similar to the one worn by Jango."
Zam Wesell,yellow,female,Clawdite,"Zam Wesell (pronounced /zæm.w?z??l/ or /zæm.?w?s?l/) was a shapeshifting Clawdite bounty hunter from the planet Zolan. In her true form, Wesell was a reptilian-like humanoid, although she often appeared as a Human woman with short blonde or bronze-colored hair. She trained in the ways of the Mabari warriors on her homeworld before eventually being labeled a heretic and fleeing to the commercial center of Denon. To escape, Wesell took the form of a human woman and took a job in personal security. Over time, she moved up through the ranks by honing her skills, gathering equipment, garnering finances and making valuable contacts which altogether allowed her to begin a career in bounty hunting.
Wesell first encountered the bounty hunter Jango Fett in 32 BBY during his search for Bando Gora outlaw leader Komari Vosa. After assisting Fett in his scheme to defeat Vosa, the two began to develop a friendship that was propagated by their periodic partnership on various contracts. One such contract arose in 27 BBY when the two bounty hunters were seeking the Infant of Shaa ancient artifact and superweapon on behalf of the Dug Fernooda. Originally pitted against each other, the pair agreed to work together to capture the idol. It was then revealed to Wesell that a seedy underworld general planned to use it to destroy the Republic capital world of Coruscant. At Wesell's lead, Fett joined in the hunt to retrieve the artifact and save Coruscant. During this incident, Wesell made use of her developed shapeshifting abilities. This skill was also employed in her other exploits, such as the hunt for Kuati Hurlo Holowan, which was subcontracted by Jango Fett.
In 22 BBY, with the rise of the Separatist Crisis, Confederate leader Count Dooku contracted Jango Fett to eliminate Senator Padmé Amidala on behalf of Nute Gunray. In turn, Fett subcontracted the bounty to Wesell, who attempted to kill the senator by destroying the senator's starship with an explosive device. The explosion, however, only served to kill Amidala's decoy and other passengers aboard the vessel. Amidala had arrived separately on another ship and was unscathed by the blast. Not pleased, but undeterred, Wesell met with Fett and schemed to use two venomous arthropods to kill the vulnerable senator. The attempt was foiled, however, by the alert presence of Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi who had been stationed in the senator's apartment. The Jedi easily killed the arthropods and Kenobi leaped through the apartment window to grab hold of the droid which Wesell had used to deliver the predators.
The droid began its return to Wesell, but the bounty hunter spotted the stowaway Jedi. Skywalker, at the same time, commandeered an airspeeder and began pursuit. After chasing Wesell through the skylanes of Coruscant, Skywalker was able to force the Clawdite to crash her airspeeder in a busy street of the Uscru Entertainment District. Wesell fled into a nearby locale and prepared to ambush the Jedi. She approached Kenobi from behind but was easily defeated and dragged from the club into a neighboring alley. There, she was silenced by her friend, Jango Fett, with a toxic dart before she could divulge his identity."
Dexter Jettster,yellow,male,Besalisk,"Dexter ""Dex"" Jettster, nicknamed Dexi Jet, was a male Besalisk with a colorful background who lived on the planet Coruscant and was the owner of Dex's Diner. Serving mostly hard workers from the area, the diner offered home-style cooked meals and freshly brewed ardees (""Jawa juice""). Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses, Hermione Bagwa and her WA-7 waitress droid partner, FLO.
It was shortly before the Clone Wars that Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend, Jettster, could identify a poisoned dart. Though few even knew of the planet Kamino, Jettster did from his days as a prospector on Subterrel and was able to identify the dart as originating from Kamino. Furthermore, he knew of the native inhabitants, the Kaminoans, who were cloners of some repute and kept to themselves but were welcoming to those who brought credits. Jettster gently chided his old friend Kenobi who as a Jedi should have put more faith in another person's wisdom than the knowledge of the Jedi Archives."
Lama Su,black,male,Kaminoan,"Lama Su was a male Kaminoan who hailed from a race of expert cloners on the planet Kamino. As Prime Minister, he personally oversaw the creation of the clone troopersthe new army of the Galactic Republicfrom Tipoca City, the capital of his homeworld. Although Kamino's contribution to the Republic Military gained Lama Su's people a seat in the Galactic Senate during the Clone Wars, their actions were also partially responsible for the systematic extermination of the Jedi Order and the rise of Darth Sidious's Galactic Empire."
Taun We,black,female,Kaminoan,"Taun We was a female Kaminoan who hailed from Kamino, an extragalactic world noted for its major cloning facilities. As the administrative aide of Prime Minister Lama Su, she was closely involved in the creation of the clone troopers, an army of elite soldiers bred to serve the Galactic Republic.
Approximately ten years before the Battle of Geonosis, Taun We and her people were hired by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic. In addition to her duties as administrative aide to Prime Minister Lama Su of Kamino, she also served as Project Coordinator for the Republic clone troopers. She closely monitored the development of the rank-and-file soldiers, as well as the training of a special unit known as clone commandos.
During the accelerated growth and training process of the clone troopers, Taun We also acted as a guardian to Boba Fett, an unmodified clone of Jango Fett, the bounty hunter who had been selected to become the army's template. Whereas Fett felt no emotional sentiments toward the rest of his copies, he regarded Boba as the only ""true clone;"" a son to be raised and cared for. With only two other female influencesMU-12 and Zam Wesellin Boba's life, Taun We became a virtual ""surrogate mother"" to Fett's son."
Jocasta Nu,blue,female,Human,"Jocasta Nu, a Force-sensitive human female, was a Jedi Master who served as the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives during the Clone Wars. In this role, Nu would assist fellow Jedi in finding information they needed from the Jedi Archives, and controlled access to the restricted Holocron Vault. Sometime prior to the Invasion of Naboo, Nu sat on the Jedi Council. Shortly before the war, she assisted Obi-Wan Kenobi in his attempt to locate the planet Kamino in the Archives. After not finding any information, and Nu's insistence that any item that did not appear in the Archives did not exist, it was determined that information about Kamino had been erased from Jedi records. During the war, Nu was attacked by bounty hunter Cato Parasitti, who was helping Cad Bane steal a holocron from the Holocron Vault. She later assisted Ahsoka Tano in finding the thief who stole the Padawan's lightsaber.

After the fall of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, and the rise of the Galactic Empire in their place, Nu survived the purge of the Jedi unlike many of her fellows and went into hiding, all the while attempting to preserve what she could of the Jedi. Determined to put a permanent end to the Jedi, the newly crowned Emperor dispatched his agents in the form of Darth Vader and the Inquisitorius to hunt her down, a hunt which culminated with Nu's death at the hands of Vader."
Ratts Tyerell,,male,Aleena,"Ratts Tyerell was an Aleena podracer pilot who flew a massive podracer during the Boonta Eve Classic podrace which took place during the Invasion of Naboo. Tyerell had a drive to beat the reigning champion, the Dug, Sebulba. During the race, Tyerell flew into the Laguna Caves, where his accelerator jammed. Unable to control his podracer, the little Aleena could only throw his arms into the air and scream as he fatally collided with a stalactite. His family was reportedly seen mourning after the race's conclusion.
A male Aleena from the planet of Aleen, the diminutive Ratts Tyerell took on the role of a professional podracer pilot, making up for his small stature with a podracer with large, oversized engines. Utilizing a team of Aleena mechanics, Tyerell toured alongside his family. Tyerell's profession earned him immense popularity on his homeworld, and was sometimes considered to be Aleen's most famous native. A small toy based off of Tyerell's podracer was also produced at some point. Tyerell eventually headed to the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine to participate in the world's largest annual podrace, the Boonta Eve Classic. The race was concurrent with an invasion on the neighboring planet of Naboo. Only a little while before the race, Tyerell's wife gave birth to a third child, a fact that eventually found its way to the race commentators Fode and Beed"
R4-P17,"red, blue",female,,"R4-P17, nicknamed R4, was a feminine R4-P astromech droid that was assigned to Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, prior to and throughout the Clone Wars. She was destroyed by a buzz droid during the Battle of Coruscant.
R4-P17 was manufactured by Industrial Automaton sometime prior to the Clone Wars. A model of the R4-P sub-line of the R4 astromech, the feminine astromech droid accompanied Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to Kamino and Geonosis as the Jedi sought to uncover the mysteries behind the assassination attempts on Naboo senator Padmé Amidala that occured on the galactic capital Coruscant.
During the final days of the Clone Wars, R4-P17 joined Obi-Wan Kenobi once again aboard his Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor in a battle above Coruscant. During the battle, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker approached Separatist General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand, in an attempt to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. As the two Jedi neared the flagship they encountered attacks from Pistoeka sabotage droids; during the attack, R4's dome was torn apart by a buzz droid, ending her career.
She was later replaced by R4-G9 as Kenobi's companion droid during his travel to the planet Utapau."
Wat Tambor,,male,Skakoan,"Wat Tambor was a male Skakoan who was the foreman of the Techno Union and an executive of Baktoid Armor Workshop. During the Separatist Crisis, he pledged the Techno Union's resources to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, earning himself a seat on the Separatist Council during the Clone Wars. In the conflict's early stages, Tambor was appointed emir of Ryloth and supervised its occupation by the Separatists, which was fiercely resisted by local Twi'lek freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla. After defying orders to abandon Ryloth when the tide of battle turned against the Separatists, Tambor was left behind and captured by the Galactic Republic. He was briefly imprisoned on Coruscant before being liberated later in the conflict.

As the Clone Wars escalated, Wat Tambor took an interest in the captive ARC trooper CT-1409, who had been captured during a battle in the Citadel but was presumed dead by the Republic. Tambor kept an unconscious Echo in a stasis chamber and managed to extract information from Echo's mind to use as an algorithm consisting of strategies devised by Echo and the Clone Captain CT-7567. While officially professing the Techno Union's neutrality, Tambor had sold the algorithm to the Separatist Admiral Trench, who used it to great effect during the Battle of Anaxes to invade the Republic world of Anaxes. Tambor's dealings with the Separatists were exposed by a Republic infiltration team consisting of Rex, Clone Force 99, and the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.

During the final days of the Clone Wars, Wat Tambor and the rest of the Separatist Council relocated from the planet Utapau to Mustafar, where they were slaughtered by Darth Vader. Following his demise, the newly-formed Galactic Empire assumed control of the Techno Union's assets."
San Hill,gold,male,Muun,"San Hill was a male Muun and Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan during the Clone Wars. He pledged the support of the Banking Clan to the Confederacy of Independent Systems and served as the financial cartel's representative on the Separatist Council. Hill was slaughtered by Darth Vader on Mustafar following the end of the Clone Wars.
A male Muun from the planet Scipio, San Hill was the Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. On the onset of the Clone Wars, Hill attended a secret meeting on Geonosis and signed a treaty with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, pledging the Banking Clan's financial and military assets to the movement, with Hill serving as the financial cartel's representative on the Separatist Council. During the final days of the Clone Wars, Hill, along with the other Separatist leaders, moved from Utapau to Mustafar where they were all killed by Darth Vader."
Shaak Ti,black,female,Togruta,"Shaak Ti was a Togruta Jedi Master and member of the Jedi Order and Jedi High Council in the waning years of the Galactic Republic. Considered to be amongst the wisest and most patient in the Order, she was a skilled fighter and devoted believer in the ways of the Jedi. During the Clone Wars, a galaxy-wide conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Ti took part in the pivotal battles of Geonosis, Kamino, and Coruscant as a general for the Grand Army of the Republic.

Early in the Clone Wars, she was chosen to represent the Republic on Kamino, where she personally oversaw the training and development of clone forces. While in this role, she became entangled in a conspiracy surrounding the origins of the organic inhibitor chips placed in every clone, and the secrets being kept from the Jedi about them. As she attempted to root out the conspiracy from ARC Trooper Fives, she clashed with Kaminoan Chief Medical Scientist Nala Se, who was attempting to dispel his claims regarding the chips' true purpose. Despite her efforts to the contrary, Ti was unable to help Fives as he suffered a breakdown, and upon his death, his secrets passed on to only a few. Ti had a tenuous relationship with the Kaminoan leadership during this time, finding difficulty in working with their emotionless demeanor and struggling to balance her compassion for the clones with the demand of producing capable soldiers for war.

As the war began to draw to a close, Ti and the Council became increasingly aware of the mystery behind the Dark Lord of the Sith, devoting much time to discovering their identity and motives. During the Battle of Coruscant in the late stages of the Clone Wars, Ti was sent to protect Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine but was knocked unconscious in a duel with Separatist General Grievous. At the war's end Ti became a victim of the Great Jedi Purge, murdered at the hands of fallen Jedi Anakin Skywalker whilst she meditated during the Siege of the Jedi Temple. Prior to her death Ti recorded a message of hope on a holocron, urging its finder to not let the fall of the Order be the end of the Jedi."
Grievous,"green, yellow",male,Kaleesh,"Grievous, formerly known as Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a Kaleesh male warlord who served as a commanding officer in the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the last years of the Galactic Republic. Although he was known by his rank as a general, Grievous was the Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army that engaged the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the pan-galactic conflict of the Clone Wars. Noted for his ruthlessness and extensive cybernetic enhancements, Grievous inspired fear as he traveled across the galaxy, invading entire worlds and engaging the Jedi Knights of the Republic.

A native of the planet Kalee, Grievous sustained severe injuries that required extensive repair by the time of the Clone Wars. Willingly submitting to a procedure that rendered him more mechanical than organic, he became a living weapon, granting him lightning-quick reflexes and devastating strength. Although he was neither Jedi or Sith, nor even sensitive to the power of the Force, Grievous was a skilled lightsaber duelist, having trained in the art of the lightsaber under the fallen Jedi Master-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku. Known for his hatred of the Jedi Order, Grievous killed Jedi over the course of the war, and would claim their lightsabers both as trophies and weapons to be used against other opponents, be they Jedi or clone troopers.

In addition to his combat skills, Grievous was a brilliant military strategist who oversaw multiple campaigns throughout the Clone Warsfrom the Battle of Kamino, where he failed to halt the production line of clone troopers; to the Battle of Dathomir, where his battle droids massacred the Nightsisters led by the witch Mother Talzin. In 19 BBY, Grievous launched a daring raid on Coruscant, the Republic capital world, resulting in the abduction of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. However, the Jedi succeeded in rescuing the Chancellor while driving back the Separatist invaders. Following the loss of Dooku, Grievous and his army went into hiding in the Outer Rim Territories. Unknown to Grievous, his master, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, betrayed the general's location to the Jedi Order, allowing them to invade the planet Utapau in an effort to bring a swift and decisive conclusion to the war. As a result, Grievous was ultimately slain by his nemesis, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose 212th Attack Battalion went on to secure Utapau even as Order 66 went into effect, marking the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire."
Tarfful,blue,male,Wookiee,"Tarfful was a male Wookiee chieftain and general who helped defend his native planet Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars. During the war, he led a band of Wookiees to answer a distress signal made by Chewbacca, who was imprisoned on the Trandoshan hunting grounds of Wasskah. Tarfful later participated in the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside Chewbacca and Jedi Master Yoda. In the wake of Order 66 and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tarrful helped facilitate Yoda's escape and continued fighting against the tyranny of the Empire in the following years. At some point prior to the Great Jedi Purge, Tarfful met and befriended Jedi Master Eno Cordova, and helped him navigate Kashyyyk to learn about Zeffo culture. A male Wookiee native to his species's homeworld of Kashyyyk, Tarfful served as the chieftain of the coastal city Kachirho at the time of the Clone Wars. He also held the rank of general among his people. One standard year into the war, one of Tarfful's fellow Wookiees, Chewbacca, was captured by Trandoshans and taken to Wasskah to be hunted for sport. There, Chewbacca managed to build a device which sent a distress signal to Kashyyyk. Upon hearing of his friend's situation, Tarfful hired the bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas to transport him and a group of his most trusted warriors to Wasskah. Once there, the chieftain and his men made quick work of the Trandoshans and rescued Chewbacca, as well as Jedi younglings Ahsoka Tano, Jinx, and O-Mer. At one point, Tarfful was captured by Trandoshan slavers who had made a deal with Count Dooku, but he was rescued by a squad of clone commandos soon after. Tarfful took part in the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside Chewbacca and Jedi Generals Yoda, Luminara Unduli and Quinlan Vos. Aided by the Grand Army of the Republic, he led a local militia against the invading Separatist droid forces. Following the implementation of Order 66, Tarfful and Chewbacca helped Yoda elude the clone troopers and escape from the planet. In the wake of the Galactic Empire's rise, Tarrful's anti-Imperial stance made him a wanted criminal, forcing him to take shelter in the Shadowlands. In 14 BBY, Saw Gerrera's rebel cell, the Partisans, agreed to help Cal Kestis and the crew of the Stinger Mantis track down Tarfful, as the Wookiee chieftan was aware of information that could aid the Jedi Padawan in locating a Jedi holocron containing a list of names of several Force-sensitive children. After locating Tarfful in the Shadowlands, the majority of the Partisans evacuated Kashyyyk, whilst Wookiee Commander Choyyssyk and Partisan Mari Kosan remained with Tarfful. Tarfful later provided the information Kestis was seeking upon the Padawan's return to Kashyyyk."
Raymus Antilles,brown,male,Human,"Raymus Antilles was a male Human and the captain of the corvette Sundered Heart at the time of the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. He served the Royal Alderaan Civil Fleet under Senator Bail Prestor Organa. During the early stages of the Civil War, he served the Rebel Alliance in the fight against the Galactic Empire. He captained the Alderaan Diplomatic Cruiser Tantive IV before his death in 0 BBY at the hands of Darth Vader.
"
Sly Moore,white,female,,"Sly Moore was a female Umbaran Force Adept who was employed by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as his Senior Administrative Aide during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. In secret, Moore was also an acolyte of the dark side, trained in the ways of the Force by Palpatine, who was in truth the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious.

Following Sidious' Declaration of a New Order, Moore became one of the first members of the Imperial Ruling Council and gained the sobriquet ""Queen of the Empire"" from the holomedia, with rumors spreading that she and the Emperor shared a relationship. She oversaw a series of experiments on Byss studying the spontaneous generation of life, which produced the future Imperial warlord Trioculus. Moore disappeared shortly into the Empire's reign, and was rumored to have died in seclusion in the Ghost Nebula after giving birth to Palpatine's biological son Triclops."
Tion Medon,black,male,Pau'an,"Tion Medon was a male Pau'an and the Master of Port Administration of Utapau. A gaunt, gray-skinned humanoid, Tion Medon wore elaborate red robes and carried an ornate staff of office. He assisted Obi-Wan Kenobi during the late Clone Wars.
A member of the tall, thin Pau'an species, Tion Medon had an unsettling appearance to some, with glassy, sunken black eyes and a mouth of crooked teeth. However, appearances were deceptive, as Tion Medon was an accommodating, helpful being. As Port Administrator of his sinkhole sanctuary of Pau City, Tion welcomed guests, offering them his services.
Longevity came naturally to the Pau'ans, and Tion Medon had been Master of Port Administration for Pau City for more than 200-standard years by the time of the Clone Wars. Tion was a descendant of Timon Medon, who was credited with unifying Utapau. Like all Pau'ans, Tion preferred darkness to sunlight, and raw meat to cooked.
In the final weeks of the Clone Wars, Tion Medon was forced to accommodate General Grievous and his associates in his sanctuary. Grievous threatened to destroy Medon's city if he did not assist, or if he were to bring in aid from the Galactic Republic. Medon had no choice but to allow the Separatists to use his sanctuary as their base of operations.
Fortunately for the Administrator, help arrived of its own accord, in the form of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Despite General Grievous's threats, Tion Medon welcomed Kenobi to the spaceport, and discreetly divulged helpful information pertaining to the Separatist presence on Utapau. Kenobi, sent by the Jedi Council to track down General Grievous, was able to seek and destroy the Separatist Supreme Commander with Tion Medon's help."
Finn,dark,male,Human,"Finn, formerly designated FN-2187 (""Eight-Seven""), was a Force-sensitive human male stormtrooper who served the First Order until his desertion and subsequent defection to the Resistance during the First OrderResistance war. Though trained since birth to be a loyal and obedient soldier, FN-2187's conscience conflicted with the methods of the First Order. For a time he was unwilling to support the Resistance, hoping to escape the galactic conflict instead of fighting for a cause he believed was doomed to fail. As the galaxy became consumed by war, the renegade trooper was ultimately forced to decide where his true loyalties lay.

Born in 11 ABY during the New Republic Era, FN-2187 was part of a new generation of stormtroopershuman children conscripted into the military forces of the First Ordermodeled on the Republic clone troopers and Imperial stormtroopers of the past. He originally trained with Batch Eight before joining the FN Corps, a sub-branch of the Stormtrooper Corps, and although his potential was recognized by his commanding officers, FN-2187 lacked the ruthlessness that had become common in the ranks under the influence of Captain Phasma. In the waning days of the Cold War, he hesitated to kill civilians during his first mission and consequently decided to desert after witnessing the massacre of Tuanul. Lacking experience as a pilot, FN-2187 freed a Resistance prisoner, Commander Poe Dameron, who coined the nickname ""Finn"" to supplant the renegade stormtrooper's alphanumeric designation. He then sought his own freedom while forming friendships with the Jakku scavenger Rey and the droid BB-8, as well as the Rebel war heroes Han Solo and Chewbacca.

After the destruction of the New Republic, Finn provided the Resistance with the information they needed to destroy the First Order's superweapon, Starkiller Base. During the attack, he was defeated and nearly killed by the dark warrior Kylo Ren. Rescued by Rey and Chewbacca, Finn recuperated from his injuries and by the time he awoke, the Resistance was forced to evacuate their base on D'Qar. Despite attempting to escape from the conflict once more, a mission with Rose Tico convinced Finn to truly join the Resistance to the extent where he nearly sacrificed his life for their cause during the Battle of Crait in 34 ABY. In 35 ABY, Finn continued assisting the Resistance by joining Rey on the quest to find the Sith wayfinder and destroy the malevolent religion once and for all, eventually becoming a general along with Poe after Leia's passing, with his first mission as a general being spent leading the ground forces during the Battle of Exegol."
Rey,hazel,female,Human,"Rey Skywalker, once known only as Rey, was a human female Jedi Master who fought on the side of the Resistance in the war against the First Order. A former scavenger from the planet Jakku, her life was changed by the tumultuous events of the last days of the New Republic Era. Her decision to help the droid BB-8 would set Rey on a course to discovering the Force that awakened within her, leading her to seek out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker for training. Yet despite her commitment to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force, Rey felt the pull to the dark side due to her anger and the adversarial relationship she had with Ben Solo, a fallen Jedi whom she knew as the dark warrior Kylo Ren. The unique Force-bond between them was a result of their nature as a dyad in the Force.

Rey was born in 15 ABY during the rise of the New Republic. Her father was a bioengineered Strand-Cast cloned from the genetic template of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who ruled the Galactic Empire as Emperor Palpatine. The clone and Rey's mother chose to live as simple junk traders in order to hide their daughter, who inherited Sidious' connection to the Force, from his followers. After the deaths of her parents, Rey was forced to survive on her own in the Jakku desert, and became a skilled mechanic, pilot and combatant in the process. Her isolated life was disrupted shortly before war broke out across the galaxy in 34 ABY. Determined to help the Resistance, Rey gained several new allies including Finn, a renegade stormtrooper, as well as the veterans Han Solo and Chewbacca. In the course of their journey, she discovered her latent Force powers and sought guidance under Skywalker, who taught her the art of the Force despite his decision to end the Jedi legacy. After Skywalker sacrificed himself to save the Resistance, Rey assumed his mantle as the last Jedi and became the apprentice of General Leia Organa.

With the return of Darth Sidious in 35 ABY, Rey set out to find the dark world of Exegol and prevent the Sith from being reborn. It was through Kylo Ren that Rey discovered her origins as the Dark Lord's granddaughter, and upon confronting Sidious in person, she was nearly swayed to the dark side of the Force. However, Rey was saved by Ben Solo after he renounced his dark alter ego. Aided by the spirits of all the Jedi, Rey died vanquishing her grandfather, causing Solo to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to bring Rey back to life. The two embraced and shared a kiss as Solo peacefully vanished in Rey's arms. Although Solo was the last of the Skywalker bloodline, Rey assumed the name ""Skywalker"" to honor their memory, repudiating her own heritage as a Palpatine."
Poe Dameron,brown,male,Human,"Poe Dameron was a human male who originally served as a member of the Spice Runners of Kijimi, before becoming a pilot in the New Republic and eventually joining the Resistance, rising to become acting General of the Resistance, during its conflict and subsequent war with the First Order. The son of Lieutenant Shara Bey and Sergeant Kes Dameron of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps in becoming a pilot, serving the New Republic Defense Fleet as the commander of Rapier Squadron, but grew disillusioned with the Republic's inaction to the First Order's violations of the Galactic Concordance. Dameron defected to the Resistance, where he became one of General Leia Organa's most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the callsign of Black Leader while piloting his specialized T-70 X-wing starfighter, Black One.

As the conflict with the First Order grew more desperate, Dameron was sent to find Lor San Tekka on Jakku, who had part of a map to locate Organa's brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Though Dameron entrusted the map to his astromech droid BB-8, he was captured by the First Order and interrogated for the location of the map, eventually being forced to hand over the information. He escaped with the help of a defecting stormtrooper, whom Dameron nicknamed Finn, and returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar on his own. He aided Finn, Rey, Han Solo, and Chewbacca with air support during the Battle of Takodana, and he later flew during the battle to destroy the superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the battle, after the base was damaged by Solo, Finn, Rey, and Chewbacca, Dameron fired the shots that destroyed the Starkiller weapon, saving the Resistance from certain destruction.

During the subsequent battle of D'Qar, Dameron disobeyed orders and led an attack on the First Order Dreadnought Fulminatrix, but his reckless actions caused him to be demoted from Wing Commander to captain. As the First Order pursued the Resistance by tracking them through hyperspace to the Crait system, Dameron did not approve of the passive strategy of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo and worked with Finn and mechanic Rose Tico to break into Supreme Leader Snoke's flagship, the Supremacy, and disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker before eventually staging a mutiny against Admiral Holdo in an effort to buy Finn and Rose time.

However, Dameron and the mutineers had not realized that Holdo's plan was to discreetly transport the Resistance to an abandoned Rebel base on the nearby planet Crait, and his group's actions caused the First Order to discover the Resistance's escape vessels and destroy many of them. Even so, General Organa gave Dameron command after Holdo sacrificed herself, and he led a last-ditch counterattack against the First Order during the Battle of Crait. The counterattack was unsuccessful, but Dameron was able to lead the surviving Resistance fighters while a Force projection of Luke Skywalker distracted Kylo Ren and the First Order, where they found their way to Rey and the Millennium Falcon, allowing them to escape.

After the escape, the group took the brief moment of peace to catch up on recent events, and as he left for the Battle of Grail City, the ace was promoted back to commander. After that, he reflected on what it truly meant to be a member of the Resistance, and how he believed it was about bringing light to dark and saving one's galaxy."
BB8,black,none,Droid,"BB-8, sometimes spelled and pronounced Beebee-Ate and nicknamed BB, was a BB-series astromech droid who operated approximately thirty years after the Battle of Endor. It had a dome head, similar to that of R2 series astromech droids, with the bulk of its body made up of a ball on which the droid's head rolled. BB-8 was mostly white, with some silver and orange on its body, as well as a black photoreceptor. The droid belonged to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whom he accompanied during his flights on his T-70 X-wing starfighter."
Captain Phasma,blue,female,,"Phasma was a human female stormtrooper captain of the First Order. Phasma grew up as a member of the Scyre clan on the nuclear-ravaged world of Parnassos. She was a formidable warrior who became the clan's military leader. Seeking passage offworld, Phasma helped the First Order General Brendol Hux find his ship in the process betraying her own brother Keldo and clan. After being rescued, Phasma joined the First Order, abandoning her former life on Parnassos.

Over the years, Phasma rose through the ranks of the First Order and became in charge of their stormtrooper training program. She conspired with Brendol's son General Armitage Hux to assassinate her former benefactor. Phasma also survived an assassination attempt by Brendol's former protege Cardinal, who sought revenge for Brendol's death. Having consolidated her position within the First Order, Phasma became part of an unofficial triumvirate consisting of General Hux and the dark enforcer Kylo Ren.

As a senior officer, Phasma commanded First Order forces in their struggle against the Resistance. Under orders from the Supreme Leader of the First Order, Snoke, the triumvirate searched for a galaxy map that would lead to the last of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker, on the planet Jakku. Phasma participated in a massacre at Tuanul village, an atrocity which led the stormtrooper FN-2187 to defect to the Resistance.

Following the Hosnian Cataclysm, Phasma was ambushed by FN-2187, now with the Resistance as Finn, who had infiltrated Starkiller Base with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. Surviving the Battle of Starkiller Base, Phasma framed Lieutenant Sol Rivas for the base's destruction and led a mission to hunt down the fugitive in order to conceal her own malfeasance. During the pursuit of the Resistance fleet, Phasma fought with the infiltrator Finn aboard the First Order flagship Supremacy, which had recently been devastated by a hyperspace ramming attack that freed the former stormtrooper. Phasma was defeated by the combined efforts of Finn and his new companion, Rose Tico. Subsequently, the captain fell to her death into a fire that was consuming the stricken ship."
Padmé Amidala,brown,female,Human,"Padmé Amidala, also known as Padmé Amidala Naberrie, was a human female senator who represented the people of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Prior to her career in the Galactic Senate, Amidala was the elected ruler of the Royal House of Naboo. A political idealist, she advocated for the preservation of democracy as well as a peaceful resolution to the Clone Wars. However, her secret marriage to the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker would have a lasting effect on the future of the galaxy for decades to come.

Born in 46 BBY during the Age of the Republic, Padmé Naberrie was raised by her parents, Ruwee Naberrie and his wife Jobal, on the peaceful Mid Rim world of Naboo. Despite the humble background of the Naberrie family, Padmé was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to civic duty, she was elected queen and, therefore, adopted the regnal name ""Amidala"" in 32 BBY. Due to the machinations of her advisor, Senator Sheev Palpatine, Amidala's reign was put to the test by the Trade Federation's blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Unable to fight the Federation's army of battle droids without assistance, the queen beseeched the Galactic Senate on Coruscant for help, only to see her efforts hampered by bureaucracy and procedure. Although she ultimately liberated her homeworld with the help of the Jedi Order and the Gungan Grand Army, her decision to cast a Vote of No Confidence against Finis Valorum enabled Palpatine to become the Supreme Chancellor.

Following her reign, Amidala joined the Senate and struggled to resolve the Separatist Crisis through diplomacy, becoming a leading voice in the Loyalist Committee by 22 BBY. After surviving an assassination attempt, she was removed from the capital and sent back to Naboo under the protection of Padawan Anakin Skywalker. Though the Jedi Code forbade personal relationships, deeming attachment, and possession unbecoming of a Jedi, the two gradually became closer as their feelings for each other grew. In the aftermath of the First Battle of Geonosis, Amidala secretly married her Jedi protector, despite her own reservations about their relationship and the consequences they would face if the truth ever came to light. Their subsequent interactions were limited throughout the Clone Wars, with Amidala continuing to advocate peaceful solutions in the Senate while Skywalker served on the front lines as a Jedi General in the Grand Army of the Republic. In the waning months of the pan-galactic conflict, Amidala revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. As a result of Skywalker's fear of loss, he was seduced by the dark side of the Force, believing that by becoming a Sith Lord he would gain the power to prevent his wife from dying in childbirth. Amidala, who learned of her husband's transformation into a Sith, ultimately died of a broken heart after giving birth to the twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Amidala Skywalker. With her dying breath, she claimed that there was still good in the former Anakin Skywalker, who embraced the persona of Darth Vader throughout the reign of the Galactic Empire.

Amidala's children played a major role in the fragmentation of the Empire and the redemption of her husband. Like her mother, Leia entered public service and became a flag-bearer for the democratic ideals of liberty and justice as a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and its successor, the New Republic, before becoming the founding general of the Resistance against the First Ordera successor state to the Galactic Empire. Luke, on the other hand, was trained in the ways of the Jedi like his father before him and was a celebrated war hero of the Rebel Alliance. Through Luke's efforts to redeem his father back to the light, Amidala's last words proved true when Anakin killed the Emperor during the Battle of Endor."
Din Djarin,brown,male,Human,"Din Djarin, commonly known as ""the Mandalorian"" or ""Mando"" for short, was a human male Mandalorian who worked as a bounty hunter during the New Republic Era. With his Mandalorian armor and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmatica stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others. Orphaned during the Republic Era and raised as a foundling, he was trained to become a Mandalorian warrior and eventually joined the Tribe, who operated on Nevarro. Djarin became battle-hardened, a man of few words, and a formidable hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy.

After the fall of the Galactic Empire, Djarin made a reputation for himself as a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, collecting bounties as he traveled across the galaxy's Outer Rim Territoriesfar from the authority of the New Republicin his personal starship, the Razor Crest. Around 9 ABY, Djarin was hired on Nevarro by a client of an Imperial remnant faction, who offered a substantial reward for the acquisition of an asset located on the world Arvala-7. During his mission on Arvala-7, he met an Ugnaught named Kuiil, who guided him to the location of the asset. On his way to the asset, Djarin encountered a droid bounty hunter, IG-11, and the two entered the building in the encampment guarded by mercenaries where the asset was kept. Upon seeing the asset itself, they discovered that it was in fact a Force-sensitive child who belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda. Djarin, who was tasked with bringing the Child alive, shot IG-11, who was about to kill the Child, and saved the infant, taking him into his custody.

Discovering the Child's Force-sensitivity during his time on Arvala-7, Djarin then took the Child back to the Client and collected his reward. However, the Mandalorian warrior had already begun to form a bond with the infant. Feeling remorseful for subjecting the Child to a cruel fate, Djarin entered the facility where the Child was kept and rescued him from the Imperials stationed there, and later fended off Guild hunters with the help of the Tribe. The two would go on to embark on various adventures around the galaxy as they formed a close bond, including an encounter with former rebel shock trooper Carasynthia Dune, a job on Tatooine, and a run-in with a group of mercenaries.

Djarin was later contacted by the Guild's agent, Greef Karga, who wished to make amends for his actions during the Child's rescue. The Guild agent offered to work with the Mandalorian to drive away the Imperials, who took control over Nevarro's city, in exchange for dropping the bounty on the Child. Djarin then gathered his alliesDune, Kuiil, and a re-programmed IG-11and met with Karga on Nevarro. Djarin and his allies entered the city and fought the Imperials led by Moff Gideon, later retreating to the Tribe's covert after facing heavy opposition. The Mandalorian known as ""The Armorer,"" who had remained in the hideout after the covert's attempted relocation, tasked Djarin with returning the Child to his people, and declared the creation of his clan. After dealing with Gideon and his remaining Imperials, Djarin departed the planet with the infant and began his search for the Child's people."
The Child,brown,male,Yoda's species,"""The Child"" was a male Force-sensitive Mandalorian foundling that belonged to the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda and Jedi Master Yaddle. The Child was born around 41 BBY, and was held at an encampment run by Nikto mercenaries on Arvala-7 during the New Republic Era. While still an infant at the age of fifty years old, he was sought by an Imperial who hired a Mandalorian bounty hunter named Din Djarin to retrieve him.

However, Djarin chose not to leave the Child with the Imperials and saved him from the Imperial remnant facility. After attempting to hide with the Child along the fringes of the galaxy, Djarin returned to Nevarro to deal with the Imperials chasing the Child in hopes of keeping him safe. In the process, the Child became a Mandalorian foundling and the single other member of Djarin's newly created clan."

During the fighting, Mercia and her husband [[Aron Holt|Aron]] were taken captive by the Sith Lord [[Odion]], who had found out about their research into the [[Helm of Ieldis]] during a raid on [[Sanbra]]. Seeking to further his nihilistic ambitions of galactic domination, Odion started [[Project Pandemonium]] to capture the Helm for himself. At an unknown point prior to their second mission to [[Sarrassia]] in [[1039 BBY]], Mercia gave birth to this child and it was forcibly taken from her by Odion's minions. The child was raised at an [[Odionate cloister]], a planet-size orphanage where children from throughout the [[Odionate]] were indoctrinated and conditioned through solitary confinement into workers and warriors for Odion's war effort.Prior to their deaths on [[Skarpos]] in [[1038 BBY]], Mercia Holt lamented in a [[Holorecorder/Legends|holorecording]] that this sibling was the child she and her husband would never know. She also expressed her hopes that Kerra had somehow survived the events on Aquilaris. In 1032 BBY, the child's older sibling Kerra Holt infiltrated the Odionate, disguised as a [[Novitiate]] and learnt about the existence of the cloisters. She speculated that the child was incarcerated there but realized the process of reuniting with that younger sibling would be complicated by an Odionate policy of not maintaining written records on the inmates.After acquiring the [[Helm of Ieldis]] on [[Skarpos]] and [[Second Battle of Skarpos|successfully testing]] it on three entire armies with devastating consequences, Odion returned to the [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of [[Vanahame]] which hosted one cloister. There, Odion intended to harness the negative emotions of the thousands of child inmates there and convert into [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] energy.

However, his plans were thwarted by Kerra and his second-in-command [[General/Legends|General]] [[Beld Yulan]] who switched back on the lights in the cloister and then freed the children, creating a surge of positive emotions like joy and relief which caused the Helm to overload, burning Odion to death.With his fiefdom already collapsing due to attacks by his [[Calimondra family|Sith relatives]], Odion attempted to parley with Kerra for his life, by offering to help her find her younger sibling if she saved him. However, Kerra by then had come around to the view that all the children in the cloisters throughout the Odionate were her brothers and sisters, regardless of their species and gender. She refused and left Odion to die. Due to the lack of documentation, Kerra realized it would be very hard to find lost family members who had been processed into the cloister system. The sibling would have grown up not knowing the identity of its parents and its relationship to Kerra.Following the [[Battle of Vanahame]], Kerra and Yulan evacuated the orphans at the Vanahame cloister into [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] Space. They managed to liberate a few other cloisters but the others had been captured by the other Sith Lords, particularly Odion's estranged younger brother [[Daiman]] who had taken up the largest chunk of the former Odionate.

Out of options, she let her debtors take ownership of the property, and then journeyed to the nearest large [[City/Legends|city]], [[Keren/Legends|Keren]], bidding farewell to the home that had been in her family for generations. Using the last of her personal savings, she volunteered for the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces/Legends|Royal Naboo Security Forces]]. After training for a year with the [[Queen/Legends|Queen's]] [[handmaidens]] in [[Theed/Legends|Theed]], she impressed [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Quarsh Panaka/Legends|Quarsh Panaka]] with her keen mind, sharp wits, and natural mimicry skills. Dané did not take well to authority, however, and she requested a transfer from the program. Panaka recommended she look into the Customs Security division, where she soon found a new home on the undercover investigations unit, which allowed her to operate more or less on her own.In [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]], she became a member of the [[Naboo Underground]] and played a minor role in defending Naboo from [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]] forces.Later, she found that her role in Customs Security was not big enough for her ambitions, and she left the division after less than three [[Standard year/Legends|years]]. Dané had learned much in that time, and developed into a sharp shot with a [[Blaster pistol/Legends|blaster]], as well as a persuasive negotiator.

After Jorran sold the damaged vaporator to Suulru he won the modulator from Daraala in a game of stones.When [[Meetra Surik]] arrived at the salvager's camp, Daraala asked Surik to find the corpses of two salvagers, offering Surik 500 [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] for each of them, claiming she wished to give them a proper burial. In reality, however, Jorran knew that all she wanted from the salvager's corpses was to get an extremely good load of salvage that the two salvagers as well as two others had managed to acquire from the ruined [[Jedi Enclave]]. The reason for her plot was that the four salvagers had the biggest haul of salvage found inside the ruins of the Jedi Enclave. They then attempted another salvage run but only two of them came out alive and the third died from his wounds. The surviving person then picked a fight with [[Gerevick]] after losing against him in a [[Pazaak/Legends|pazaak]] game. With all four dead, their salvage was left inside the [[Khoonda]] [[Khoonda Militia|Militia's]] headquarters.Salvagers had been attempting to claim the salvage with false claims that they were owed by the salvagers, or were related, but [[Zherron]] wasn't fooled and the only thing he would believe is a will. One of the dead salvagers in the Enclave had a badly spelled will that stated that his possessions would be given to another salvager should the latter die, which meant that the will was useless since the other salvager was also dead. Daraala hoped to trick Zherron by using the bodies and a conveniently faked will so she would make a large profit out of this. Surik most likely gave the bodies to Zherron with the will as she found it. This meant that Zherron would still have to keep the salvage."

The [[Sexes/Legends|girls]] were taken offworld and they joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]].

Most notably, she gave the command which disabled the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] [[Rebel Dream|''Tyrant'']], allowing the first [[GR-75 medium transport/Legends|GR-75 medium transport]], the [[Quantum Storm/Legends|''Quantum Storm'']], to escape through the blockade, which served as the opening shots of the engagement.Toryn was among the last Rebels to abandon Echo Base, leaving her station only after [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] ordered the final evacuation. After broadcasting the evacuation code signal to the surviving soldiers and pilots still engaging the Imperial assault force, she was the final person to leave the command center. Toryn escaped on the last transport to leave Hoth, the [[Bright Hope/Legends|''Bright Hope'']].Prior to boarding the transport, Toryn was stunned to see a large number of badly wounded soldiers still lying on the flight deck before the ship. Among the wounded was her sister, Samoc Farr, a talented [[T-47 airspeeder/Legends|snowspeeder]] pilot. Knowing her sister had been shot down led her to the realization of how truly horrific the battle outside had been.Toryn was instrumental in buying the wounded just enough time to board the transport before invading [[Cold assault stormtrooper|snowtroopers]] descended on the hangar.

They masqueraded as rescuers, when they were actually responsible for firing on the ''Bright Hope'' and preventing its escape. The truth behind their facade was to take the Rebels and use them as bait to capture Han Solo, and later, turn him in to [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]].Following a brief melee, Toryn convinced the bounty hunters to take all ninety remaining Rebels on board and deliver them to the Rebel underground on [[Darlyn Boda/Legends|Darlyn Boda]]. Before evacuating the ship, she dutifully erased all [[Computer/Legends|computer]] records on board, preventing vital information from falling into Imperial hands, including the names of many personnel who served at Echo Base.After spending a month on Darlyn Boda following her escape from Hoth, Toryn finally rejoined the [[Alliance Fleet/Legends|Rebel fleet]] at the secret [[Haven (rendezvous point)|rendezvous point]].

Her hope in coming to Dantooine was to make contact with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] base hidden there, to discover the state of the resistance, and aid the rebellion in any way she could. She took charge of guerrilla activities among the native Dantari tribes, disrupting the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire's]] activities on Dantooine as best she could.While there, she did meet with a Rebel operative, informing them of her past before tasking them with intercepting a squad of [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] to stop them from slaughtering dozens of natives. The individual managed to perform the task and, upon returning to Judarrl, was given another; to rescue the daughter of the Dantari chieftain, [[Aroho Preni]], who had been assisting Judarrl from the Imperials. The individual accepted this challenge and, after defeating the chieftain's Imperial guards, brought him to Judarrl where they were once again informed of another task.Judarrl had been informed that an Imperial by the name of [[Luthik Uwyr]] had arrived on the planet and was organizing some of the natives into a deadly strike force by teaching them to use the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. She decided that he had to be stopped before such agents of evil could spread their practices offworld.

However, the Marauder was able to get the jump on Dree and Crian and blasted their ship, damaging it beyond repair and sending it on a doomsday decline to the forested planet below. However, Dree and her Master were also able to damage Krul's ship, sending it plunging to the planet as well.Dree and her Master survived the crash, but were now at the mercy of the planet&amp;mdash;and worst of all, at the mercy of Kaox Krul, who had survived his landing as well. Dree and Crian surmised that they needed to put some forest between them and the Madman so as to keep ahead of him. However, as Crian was preparing the ship's [[Speeder bike/Legends|speeder bike]] that had survived the crash, Krul was upon them. Dree was forced to engage him in battle but was rescued by Crian who snatched Dree up onto the bike as she sped past the fray.Zooming into the forest, the two Jedi thought the bike would help them put some distance between them and Krul. However, Krul opened himself up to the power of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], using it to give him incredible speed and allowing him to keep up with the bike. Slashing out with his [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]], Krul cut cable lines causing the bike to slowly lose power. However, Krul's swipe also caused him to lose his footing, sending him crashing into the ground and allowing Dree and Crian to escape, at least for the moment.For two days afterward, Dree and Crian were able to elude Krul, but eventually he caught up with them. The showdown came one night when Dree awoke alone in a makeshift hideaway in a forest cave. Following her senses to a lake located in the middle of the forest, Dree found her Master standing at the shore. Without warning, Krul appeared and attacked Dree's Master. Dree watched as Crian traded strikes with the Dark Killer, and Dree watched and saw her Master start to lose ground against him. Feeling her master needed help, Dree joined in the battle and forced Krul into a two-on-one fight.However, Krul was more than up to the challenge and took on the two Jedi. Although Dree and Crian were both strong in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], Krul had fully opened himself up to the powers of the dark side. Sending Crian flying into the lake with a powerful Force blow, Krul launched himself up and over Dree, landing behind her. Before Dree had a chance to react, Krul ran her through with his lightsaber. Before the eyes of her Master, Dree Vandap fell and became [[Force ghost|one with the Force]]."

Mawkran, who was able to speak accented [[Galactic Basic Standard|Basic]], revealed that it was Sundown, not them, who was behind many of the murders that had plagued the countryside, including that of Nella's mother. For some reason, he seemed to want the Savrips hated, and by now they had been driven into near-extinction. His clan were the last, and now there where going to fight back - or die. Nella then agreed to help Qui-Gon and the Savrips to fight Sundown.The Savrips thus attacked his main headquarters at the Ten Mile Plateau. Sundown himself was killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his mistress, the Baroness [[Omnino]], by Master Jinn. However, a militia of moisture farmers, who had observed the battle, thought the Savrips had launched a general attack on Ord Mantell's [[Human/Legends|Human]] community, with Nella as their hostage. Sneaking up on the victorious heroes, they shot Mawkran, who stood the closest to Nella, in the back, killing him. The misunderstanding was eventually resolved, but that did not bring him back.Nella, very touched by the Savrips' sacrifice, vowed to spend her life trying to undo the wrongs that had been committed against them. However, she was powerless to prevent their later decline."

Rahasia Sandral,NaN,Female,Human,"Rahasia was born in the [[Core Worlds/Legends|Core Worlds]] on the planet of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to [[Nurik Sandral]]. The name and history of her mother is unknown, only that she died giving birth to Rahasia. Rahasia was the youngest of two children, and had an older brother named [[Casus Sandral|Casus]]. By the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Nurik decided to move his small family away from the destruction and corruption of the [[Inner Rim/Legends|Inner Rim]]. He chose a quaint planet in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] named [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] and invested in the construction of a large estate on the peaceful plains of the planet.To Nurik's dismay, the peace that he had sought on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]] only lasted for a few short years. It wasn't death; it wasn't politics; and it wasn't disease; it was [[Ahlan Matale]]. Not many know what the real cause of the Sandral/Matale feud was. Perhaps it was the border dispute between the two men; or when Nurik's droid shipment went missing; or the random acts of vandalism on Ahlan's estate. Either way, the two men hated each other almost to the point of going to war.Nurik barred Rahasia and Casus from interacting with any member of the [[Matale family]], especially Ahlan's only son, [[Shen Matale]]. But Nurik could not keep his kids caged for long. Rahasia frequently accompanied her brother Casus on his exploration of the plains of Dantooine, as he was an amateur archaeologist. One day, Casus and Rahasia met Shen. It wasn't long before Shen became friends with Casus and fell in love with his younger sister, Rahasia.But all was not to last. Casus went missing, and distraught with grief, Nurik turned to the man he despised, [[Ahlan Matale]]. Nurik blamed Ahlan for Casus' disappearance, and it wasn't long before he kidnapped [[Shen Matale]]. When Rahasia found out about her father's actions, she became hysterical. What would Nurik do to Shen? Kill him? Torture him? She didn't know what to do, until [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] showed up.[[Revan/Legends|Revan]] came into the courtyard of the Sandral's estate and questioned Nurik about Shen's disappearance. Nurik denied that he knew anything about Shen's disappearance but brought up that his son, Casus, had also gone missing. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] gave Nurik a datapad and told him that Casus had been killed by [[Kath hound/Legends|kath hounds]] out on the plains. Nurik, tortured with grief, took the datapad and left the courtyard, saying he knew nothing of Shen's disappearance. Rahasia had eavesdropped on all of this, and once Nurik had left, she went out in the courtyard and told [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] everything. Everything from her and Shen's love to Nurik kidnapping Shen. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] told her that he would have to confront Nurik, but she begged him not to judge Nurik too harshly. Rahasia gave [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] a pass key to the back of the house, telling him that Shen was in one of the holding cells. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] left, and Rahasia went to her room, praying that the Jedi would save Shen.Ten minutes after Rahasia went into her room, [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] came in and told her that Shen would not leave unless she met him outside of the Sandral Estate. A smile played at Rahasia's lips as she told [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] that she would meet them just beyond the Sandral estate. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] left, and Rahasia quickly made her way to the borders of the Sandral estate.When Rahasia saw Shen come out and meet him, she ran up to him and held him in a fierce embrace. Shen and Rahasia both thanked [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] for all he had done. Before they could leave, Ahlan came up to them with two assault droids flanking him. He soon began to shout obscenities at [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], Shen, and Rahasia. Soon after, Nurik came out of his estate with his own two battle droids. Ahlan and Nurik engaged in an intense debate filled with sneering, mocking, and arguing. Shen and Rahasia both pleaded with them to stop the fighting, but it wasn't until [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] stepped in that the two old men actually listened. [[Revan/Legends|Revan]], backed up by Shen and Rahasia, reasoned with Nurik and Ahlan to stop the fighting and let Shen and Rahasia get married. The two began to talk to each other about it and finally decided that they would build Rahasia and Shen their own estate. Rahasia and Shen both thanked [[Revan/Legends|Revan]] for what he did for them."

Reymet brashly confronted one of the [[guard]]s, who then threatened to place Reymet in jail alongside Siao. Suddenly, his uncle Venco appeared and skillfully bribed the guards to release Siao, who was overjoyed to be set free. The pair immediately began to make plans once more to move to Felacat, and Venco himself said that he would foot the bill for their departure. First, however, Venco asked Reymet to repay him for his kindness with a small favor&amp;mdash;the access codes known only to Senate Guards. Reymet, not fully aware of his uncle's past, was impressed by Venco's generosity, and agreed to his stipulations. As Reymet's codes had been invalidated due to his suspension from the Academy, he gave Venco his father's access codes, which Autem was unaware that his son knew.Soon, Reymet was confronted by his father while packing to leave with Siao, and he was made aware of the full breadth of Venco's sins; the planning of two [[Assassin/Legends|assassinations]], one [[Jheramahd Greyshade|completed]] and one still in [[Simon Greyshade/Legends|motion]], in order to bench the [[Financial Reform Act]] that sought to prevent the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] from [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|tearing apart]].

Raabakyysh,NaN,Female,Wookiee,"Raabakyysh (Raaba for short) was the best friend of [[Sirrakuk]], sister to Jedi Knight [[Lowbacca]]. Raaba was known for her rebellious style and attitude, often shaving her fur into unusual patterns in order to stand out - a trait which she passed on to Sirrakuk. As they grew older, it became apparent that there was an attraction between Lowbacca and the younger Raaba. In other ways, however, Raaba often showed a disdain for Wookiee traditions and often dreamed of leaving the planet to strike out on her own.Growing up, Raaba had always admired Lowbacca for his bravery, and therefore attempted to duplicate his [[Hrrtayyk ceremony/Legends|Hrrtayyk ceremony]] by sneaking alone into the lower levels of [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] to capture fibers of the dangerous syren plant. Unlike Lowbaaca, however, Raaba never returned from her trip. Upon finding her bloody pack, her friends and family assumed she had died - an event which caused much grief for Lowbacca and his sister. Lowie and his friends traveled to Kashyyyk so that he could be with Sirra during her period of mourning.Unbeknownst to her friends, Raaba had miraculously survived her dangerous adventure. After being attacked and wounded by a jungle predator, Raaba had made her way back to the city and stowed away aboard a departing freighter. The captain of the freighter introduced her to the recently-formed [[Diversity Alliance]] organization, which she ended up joining. Working under the personal command of [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] [[Nolaa Tarkona]], Raaba found herself in a position of some influence within the group. Two years later, she would again meet Lowbacca while he and his friends searched for [[Bornan Thul]] on the planet Kuar.Deciding to reveal herself to family and friends, Raaba returned to Kashyyyk with Lowbacca and completed her Rite of Passage. She then invited both Lowbacca and Sirra to join her on [[Ryloth]] where she hoped to recruit them into the Diversity Alliance. When the [[Solo twins]] and their friends arrived to check up on Lowie, Raaba helped Nolaa Tarkona to keep them away from Lowie &amp; Sirra. Although she didn't trust the humans, she truly feared that she would again lose her friends - this time to the Solo's concerns over the Diversity Alliance.Later, Raaba participated in the Diversity Alliance attack on the secret storeroom of the late [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. The storage facility - where the Emperor had kept his biological weapons - was the primary goal of Nolaa Tarkona, who wished to use one of the plagues in committing genocide of the human species. Commanding the Alliance fleet in space while Nolaa explored the facility, Raaba sighted a ship circling the asteroid and was dismayed to recognize it as the Rock Dragon, [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka's]] personal ship. Raaba knew that Lowie and his friends were also at the facility, and found herself conflicted between duty to Nolaa Tarkona and her concern for Lowbacca. When a New Republic fleet arrived to destroy the asteroid, Raaba personally descended to the facility to save Nolaa Tarkona. The pair ended up fleeing the battle in Raaba's personal ship, The Rising Star, although Nolaa - and possibly Raaba as well - had been exposed to multiple biological weapons on the asteroid. Before fleeing the system, Raaba sent a short coded message to Lowbacca: ""If I survive, I'll find you.""Refusing to risk the spread of whatever diseases they had been exposed to, Raaba took herself and Nolaa to an uninhabited moon deep in the Outer Rim territories. Although both beings had been exposed to the plagues, Raaba recovered around the same time that Nolaa succumbed to her illness. Raaba vowed to return to the galaxy, but not until she was certain she wouldn't spread the plague to others."

In the chaos, Plourr was the only member of the royal house to escape; although in fact, it was Plourr herself, and not the [[Priamsta]], who killed arguably the most important member of the ruling dynasty: her vicious, psychotic brother [[Prince/Legends|Prince]] [[Harrandatha Estillo|Harran]], who had become [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] protégé, and who attempted to stop her escaping so he could watch her die.Not much is known about the first years of Plourr's exile, except that she seems to have picked up a great deal of engineering knowledge and some piloting skills. The muscular, shaven-headed mechanic who eventually found her way into the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] was hardly recognizable as a princess of ancient lineage. By the time of the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], she was serving as a non-commissioned technician aboard [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar/Legends|Ackbar's]] flagship [[Home One/Legends|''Home One'']], and after Endor, she transferred to fly [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wings]]; although her attitude caused her problems in her early units, her reputation as a tough, brilliant pilot led [[Wedge Antilles/Legends|Wedge Antilles]] to bring her into [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue Squadron]], where she quickly earned a [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant's]] rank.Highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, Plourr combined her great physical strength and athletic appearance with a rather short temper and an almost eternally suspicious attitude; especially towards incompetent [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] mechanics, many of whom fell victim to the combination of strength and mood. She also excelled in black humor, not passing the opportunity to let go of a wry comment or two, even in the heat of battle. A warrior, she took great pride in military action and preferred head-to-head combat to covert operations, even though her service with the Rogues meant that she had to participate in more undercover missions than the average fighter pilot.[[File:Plourr ibitsam.jpg|250px|thumb|Plourr Ilo and fellow [[Rogue Squadron/Legends|Rogue]] [[Ibtisam]] shake hands.]]Understandably, given her upbringing, Plourr hated the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] and everything that it stood for. Some months into her service with the Rogues, however, she was recalled to her homeworld, where the ruling council of the nobility, the Priamsta, hoped that she could become the figurehead of a unity regime, ending both the tyranny of [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Leonia Tavira]] and the terrorism of the [[People's Liberation Battalion]], led by [[Harrandatha Estillo (impostor)|an impostor]] who claimed to be Prince Harran. With the help of the Rogues Plourr successfully exposed the false Harran as a fraud&amp;mdash;and, moreover, an agent of Tavira's. Taking power as [[Princess of the Realm]] and [[Princess of the Realm|Empress Apparent-Heir]], Plourr subsequently remained on Eiattu to lead her people once the Imperials had been expelled, insisting on ruling with the cooperation of the people and not simply the Priamsta, and was reunited with her father's cousin, to whom she was betrothed to as a child, [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Rial Pernon]].This did not, however, end her association with the Rogues: she brought Eiattuan starfighter forces to support the Rogues on [[Malrev IV]], and Wedge allowed her to return to serve with them when she was able to, as she did in helping to [[Mission to Corellia (Rogue Squadron)|retrieve]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] defector [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Soontir Fel]]'s family on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] from the clutches of Imperial agent [[Ilir Post]]. However, her duties on Eiattu demanded much of her time, and with Rial by her side, she grew rapidly into the role of planetary leader. She even began to grow her hair out again. Her instincts in conflict situations were still often for direct military intervention, however, as was seen not just at [[Battle of Malrev IV (Galactic Civil War)|Malrev IV]], but later when she offered to lead her fleet to rescue the captured Princess [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], actually a disguised [[Winter Celchu|Winter]], who had been [[Mission to Eiattu 6|kidnapped]] by the pirate gang now led by the ousted Leonia Tavira."

She hired the [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[BoShek/Legends|BoShek]] to get her to safety from the Rebel leaders [[Karn]] and [[Lhira]], letting him think that she was no more than another individual turned off by the extremism of the Rebellion.Once BoShek delivered her to safety, Bex allowed him to be arrested by Imperial officers after he turned down her offer of Imperial employment, even though she had grown attracted to him during their night together and had kissed him passionately only moments before. A few months later, she would come to the aid of the [[Ahakistan rebels]] looking to sabotage an Imperial [[The Hub (computer)|computer hub]] at [[Pyramid One]], in the hopes that her new allies could help reunite her with the imprisoned BoShek. She met the rebels at the [[Daystar Casino/Legends|Daystar Casino]] whose owner had brought with himself a motley group who he had claimed were members of the Rebel Alliance.At first, the Rebel cell members were suspicious of her presence but welcomed her at the behest of [[Sardoth]] who also told [[Tarson]] that she was looking for BoShek. During the meeting, Sardoth informed the cell members that the Empire had been using Ahakista as a base for [[The Hub (computer)|the Hub]], a supercomputer housed inside [[Pyramid One|the pyramid]] at the center of the city. The Hub was of great importance to the Empire, since it purpose was to coordinate the vast [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]].Part of the plot for infiltrating the Hub involved using an ancient series of tunnels under the pyramid which housed the Hub. However, these tunnels were blocked by a [[Blast door/Legends|blast door]] blocked by a protective [[Force field/Legends|energy field]] and guarded by [[Stormtrooper/Legends|Stormtroopers]]. Due to her knowledge of the building, Bex was assigned the job of disabling the energy field. The only way was to destroy its power source which was the grid's power control station on the tenth floor. Sardoth then came to the reason for why he had contacted Dunlan: He wanted Dunlan's group of rebels to destroy the pyramid's power control station so that the off-worlders could infiltrate and destroy the Hub itself.However, this plan sparked division among the Rebel cell members particularly Dunlan who argued that a frontal assault on the pyramid was suicidal, resulting in heavy casualties. Enraged, Dunlan and other members of the local Ahakistan resistance stormed out of the meeting. Amidst the uproar, Rasha commented that without Dunlan attacking the power station, the plan would fall apart. Discouraged, Bex attempted to back-out of the plot but was stopped by Tarson who ordered her to find a way to shut down the power generator or she would never see Boshek again. He then reiterated that they were taking the Hub and they were doing it now despite Dunlan's withdrawal.[[File:Rasha bex imp johdpurs.jpg|thumb|right|Bex in an Imperial uniform.]]Arriving at the power control station on the tenth floor of [[Pyramid One]], Captain Bex was confronted by an inquisitive [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Tregor]] who was suspicious of her presence in a maximum-security area. Rasha claimed that she was there to appraise his security arrangements as part of a new security initiative brought in by [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. She reiterated that any lack of compliance would be reported. As Bex approached the power generator controls, she attempted to find away to shut them down but was cornered by Tregor.Burning with rage and taking note of her suspicious behavior, Tregor attempted to expose her. With her cover exposed, Bex pushed away his hands and kicked him in the lips. Taking advantage of his bigger size, Tregor quickly regained the upper hand and wrestled her to the floor. He was about to kill her on the spot when he was caught in an explosion that incapacitated him. On the run from Vader's troops, a wounded Dunlan had fired a surface-to-air missile at the power generator. With the power generator destroyed and Tregor incapacitated, a shocked Bex made her way out of the station."

Jahren had business dealings with [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Ragez D'Asta]], and Mirith ended up befriending the Baron's daughter, [[Feena D'Asta|Feena]].There was talk among the citizens of a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]] and an end to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. However, Nez Peron remained an Imperial world despite its starving population. Jahren sought reform and justice and was elected to speak on behalf of Nez Peron's farmers. Jahren decided not to hand over their produce to the Empire. This was a doomed plan, as [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] came to Nez Peron and smashed the blossoming resistance. Vader murdered Jahren Sinn himself, and his wife, Mirith, vowed her allegiance to the Rebel Alliance then and there, promising herself that she would keep fighting the Empire until it was no more.[[File:Mirith-torture.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Mirith being tortured by Imperial Guard Carnor Jax's men]]For the remainder of the war, Sinn served with the Alliance through the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] and the creation of the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]]. She served as a soldier in the New Republic's [[Battle of Mokk IX|liberation]] of [[Mokk IX]], where she cared for an injured [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] named [[Sish Sadeet]]. After he recovered, Sadeet joined the New Republic and served as her second-in-command, forming a strong loyalty to her.Sinn&amp;mdash;now a [[Commander/Legends|commander]]&amp;mdash;led New Republic forces still actively fighting against the Empire. She had been found to be a natural-born leader, and would willingly lay her life down for the soldiers under her command. When [[Carnor Jax]] usurped the [[Imperial Ruling Council/Legends|Imperial Interim Ruling Council]], Sinn was stationed on [[Phaeda/Legends|Phaeda]], leading an underground resistance force. It was then that Kir Kanos arrived.Kanos, the former [[Emperor's Royal Guard/Legends|Imperial Royal Guard]] who sought revenge for the death of [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] against Carnor Jax and the Interim Ruling Council, found his way to Phaeda and was given sanctuary by [[Tem Merkon]]. Sinn was initially very skeptical of Kanos's intentions. Kanos would gain the trust of Sinn and her [[Trandoshan/Legends|Trandoshan]] [[Lieutenant/Legends|lieutenant]], [[Sish Sadeet]], upon [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Xexus Shev]]'s attack. Kanos nearly single-handedly saved the New Republic base from Shev's forces.Meanwhile, Carnor Jax was en route to Phaeda to apprehend Kanos. Sinn and Sadeet learned that Tem Markon had revealed Kanos's presence to Jax, who began proactively searching Phaeda. In disguise, Sinn attempted to retrieve Kanos's ship, but was captured by Jax's [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]], believing her to be Kanos. Jax [[Torture/Legends|tortured]] Sinn, seeking the whereabouts of Kanos. As carefully planned by Kanos and Sinn, she revealed his location to be [[Yinchorr/Legends|Yinchorr]]. Jax released Sinn and set out for Yinchorr. Along with Sadeet, Sinn followed.Upon her arrival on Yinchorr, Kanos and Jax were locked in mortal combat on [[The Squall]]. When Kanos nearly killed Jax, Sinn and Sadeet demanded to take him alive&amp;mdash;something Kanos refused to allow. In attempting to wrest Kanos away from Jax, Sadeet was impaled and killed. Sinn was outraged and swore her revenge against Kanos, who left shortly thereafter, leaving Jax dead.Sinn went on to seek out Kanos in revenge for the death of Sadeet. However, she also became involved in the search for Feena D'Asta and found her way to the den of [[Grappa (Hutt)|Grappa]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] on [[Genon]]. Meanwhile, Kanos had infiltrated Grappa's entourage as the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Kenix Kil]], as part of his own agenda to eliminate the members of the Interim Ruling Council. Sinn soon discovered Feena D'Asta and uncovered a [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] plot to replace Council members with [[Cloning/Legends|clones]]. However, Sinn was found out by Grappa by a former subordinate of hers, [[Massimo]]. Massimo told Grappa what she was really up to, and he had them both sent to [[Xo]], homeworld of the terrifying [[Zanibar]].[[File:Kanos8.JPG|thumb|right|140px|Kir Kanos and Mirith kiss.]]Kir Kanos stole an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor/Legends|A-wing]] and followed, intent on rescuing Sinn. Sure enough, he found her just in time&amp;mdash;Massimo had already been sacrificed in the Zanibars' horrific ceremony. Kanos and Sinn fled from the Zanibar and crashed into the jungle, far from the Zanibar settlement. Together, they made their way through the jungle, fending off carnivorous plants and animals. Using an overcharged [[Blaster/Legends|blaster]] to provide warmth, the two spoke with each other into the night. Sinn revealed to Kanos the story of her husband's death and asked whether the Empire Kanos believed in even existed. Despite their differences, they began to fall in love.The next morning, they were attacked by the Zanibar. Sinn, however, was rescued by [[Tav Kennede|a friend]] of Kanos's, leaving him behind and leaving Sinn distraught. Having lost Kanos, Sinn returned to New Republic space and learned that Kanos would be brought to Grappa on Genon. Sinn geared up and led a direct assault on Grappa's base and infiltrated it to rescue Kanos. Reunited, Sinn and Kanos moved on to their final task.On [[Ord Cantrell/Legends|Ord Cantrell]], Sinn and Kanos revealed Black Sun's cloning plot to [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Ragez D'Asta]], who had also been reunited&amp;mdash;with his daughter Feena. Kanos nearly killed Feena for her part in the Ruling Council, but Sinn stayed his hand, demanding to be even for Sadeet's death. Along came [[Xandel Carivus]], ''de facto'' [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] and the final target of Kanos's vendetta. He ordered his personal guards to kill Sinn and Kanos, who made short work of them. Kanos then pursued Carivus and killed him. Even though a number of Council members were still at large, Kanos decided he had done enough killing and ended his crusade.Sinn and Kanos returned to the New Republic battle fleet following the defeat of Xandel Carivus. Sinn had come to realize that Kanos had the same qualities of personality that had attracted her to Jahren. Despite Sinn's plea that Kanos remain with the New Republic&amp;mdash;and with her&amp;mdash;Kanos remained loyal to Palpatine's Empire. Before leaving in a borrowed [[T-65 X-wing starfighter/Legends|X-wing]], Kanos and Sinn shared one long, passionate, and final kiss."

In truth, she was frustrated by what she saw as a meaningless posting in [[Drev'starn]], and held onto the forlorn hope that Consul-General Pring would notice her diligence, and recommend her for promotion.Tammok's primary duties were twofold: she had to ensure the security of the diplomatic compound at all times, and protect the mission's computer systems; and to these ends, her command was divided between a military detachment and a cadre of [[Slicer/Legends|slicers]].

Thrynka Padaunete,NaN,Female,NaN,"Thrynka Padaunete believed that the Jedi were manipulating the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in their own push for power, so she founded the group People's Inquest and became its first president. She was often interviewed for articles pertaining to Jedi controversies on the [[HoloNet/Legends|HoloNet]]. Since the people of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] financed the Jedi Order, she believed that the people should be able to hold them accountable for their actions - though she found them at fault more often than not.In [[23 BBY/Legends|23 BBY]], a groundquake on [[Ord Thoden]] left the one-year old [[Ludi Billane]] orphaned, and she was rescued by the Jedi on the scene. As she was [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], they took her to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to begin her [[Jedi training/Legends|Jedi training]]. When it was discovered that her mother, [[Jonava Billane]], was alive and wanted her daughter back, the Jedi refused, claiming it would be dangerous since the child - now called Aris-Del Wari - had been introduced to the ways of the Force. Padaunete lent her group's support to Billane, and held this incident as evidence the Jedi should be scrutinized closer than they had been.After the Jedi failed to prevent the [[Battle of Antar 4]], public support for the Order dropped and the People's Inquest gained momentum.When the Jedi Order unveiled their new starfighter, the [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor/Legends|Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor]], the People's Inquest demanded that the Order release their budgetary information, so the people of the Republic could see how much was being spent for the Jedi's needs. After the [[Judicial Department/Legends|Judicial Department]] denied their requests based on security concerns, Padaunete held a rally in front of the [[Jedi Temple]]. She called the new starfighter a ""shiny toy"", that shouldn't take precedence when the people of the Republic were having trouble making ends meet. She claimed their petition had garnered several million signatures.Eight weeks after Aris-Del Wari was taken by the Jedi Order, Padaunete had taken on the role of Billane's appearance manager. She and Billane appeared on the [[holoprogram]], [[Essence]]. Billane appealed to the Jedi Order yet again to let her take her child back, but refused to discuss the new [[Untitled Baby Ludi Project]] holo feature, which was reported to be worth over 100 million [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]]. Padaunete changed the subject back to the Jedi, claiming they were nothing better than a cult that only sought to further their own agenda. She also claimed that they had decided that ""a mother's love is wrong"". A copy of the holoprogram was then put up for sale, with some of the proceeds going to People's Inquest.When twenty university students stormed the Jedi Temple in support for Billane and overwhelmed two young [[Padawan/Legends|Padawans]], [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Plo Koon/Legends|Plo Koon]] was forced to use a [[Mind trick/Legends|mind trick]] to convince the students to disperse quietly. After the students were arrested, the HoloNet News tried to reach Billane for a comment, but she was too busy reviewing the script for the holo feature. Padaunete, now Billane's spokeswoman and agent, responded quickly, but was busy herself fielding other calls.She soon became too busy to engage in the activities of her group, and instead went to [[Kassido]] to review casting auditions with Billane. She was immediately succeeded by [[Firris Palbert]] as President of People's Inquest, who held a rally outside the Jedi Temple after Wari was moved to the [[Kamparas Jedi Training Center]].In the wake of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]], her group aided the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] by compiling a list of all known Jedi that were still at large, along with information on other Force-using sects."

Tamith Kai,NaN,Female,Human,"When the [[Great Canyon Clan]] on [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]] allied with [[Brakiss]]'s [[Shadow Academy]], Tamith Kai volunteered herself to be Brakiss's liaison and eventually became the Shadow Academy's assistant instuctor. She was responsible for recruiting, combat training and discipline.Tamith Kai trained her students and bided her time until the order was given in [[23 ABY/Legends|23 ABY]] to start taking more students by force. She spearheaded the raid on [[GemDiver Station]] and engineered the kidnapping the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] trainees [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], [[Jaina Solo Fel|Jaina Solo]] and [[Lowbacca]]. She and Brakiss split the new recruits among themselves.After Lowbacca and Jaina disrupted one of Brakiss's lectures, Brakiss decided that the training of the new recruits would be split between himself and Tamith Kai. She would train Lowbacca, who had demonstrated that he was quick to anger when Brakiss punished Jaina for her insubordination. Tamith Kai planned to use the young Wookiee's short temper to lure him to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]], resorting to [[Torture/Legends|torture]]. When Lowbacca gave in to his anger, smashing a [[sonic generator]] beyond repair, Tamith Kai rewarded him by giving a reprogrammed [[M-TD|Em Teedee]] back to him. The little translator [[Droid/Legends|droid's]] increased level of capacity for annoyance and newfound loyalty to the Second Imperium had the opposite of the intended effect on Lowbacca, however.[[File:Tamith Kai JATM.jpg|thumb|left|Tamith Kai wielding a lightsaber.]]Brakiss and Tamith Kai's efforts were in vain, as the plot was foiled by [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka]]. As the twins and Lowbacca made their escape, Tamith Kai confronted Tenel Ka, promising to turn her to the dark side after killing the young warrior girl's friends. Tenel Ka responded by wounding Tamith Kai's knee. This confrontation created a strong sense animosity between the two [[Witches of Dathomir|Dathomiri]].In the wake of that debacle, Brakiss decided that capturing such high profile candidates would only lead to unwanted attention. The Shadow Academy would instead rely on the disadvantaged youths of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and other worlds to fill the ranks of the [[Second Imperium]]. If they were [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]], then they could be trained as [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] and if not, they could still be useful as [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] or [[TIE pilot]]s.Along with [[Garowyn]], Tamith Kai took her new apprentice, [[Vilas]], down to the [[Coruscant underworld/Legends|undercity of Coruscant]] to do their work. More often than not, they used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to simply convince their quarry to go with them, but some like [[Zekk]] proved more of a trouble and thus needed to be stunned before being taken to the Shadow Academy. However, he didn't cause any more trouble once he was aboard the [[Space station/Legends|space station]].Tamith Kai took a disliking to Zekk, mainly because he became more proficient in the dark side than her own apprentice Vilas. After Zekk had slain Vilas in a contest to determine who was to be the Shadow Academy's [[Darkest Knight]], Tamith Kai became outright hostile towards Zekk. Later, when Brakiss paired them up for a raid on [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]], Tamith Kai expressed her distrust of the Darkest Knight, not thinking that he was loyal enough. When she found out that Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka and Lowbacca were on Kashyyyk, she tried to make Zekk prove his loyalty. She reasoned that if he was loyal, Zekk would kill his former friends without a doubt in his mind. When he failed to do so, her distrust of him went even deeper.Shortly thereafter, both Zekk and Tamith Kai were selected to lead the [[Third Battle of Yavin|assault on the Jedi Praxeum]]. While Zekk chose to lead the Dark Jedi forces on ground, Tamith Kai chose to lead from a floating platform. After a duel with Tenel Ka, the floating platform she was on was sabotaged by the warrior girl. The platform then crashed into a river, killing Tamith Kai."

Cathea and the children hid together in a basement and were eventually found by [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] after the raid.Since the building was set to explode through demolition bombs in only a matter of minutes, the rescuers had no other option but to take them with themselves.Whereas [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] intended to drop the children off at the next [[spaceport]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]] advocated for taking them to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]].Having been tasked by the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] to bring a load of [[Spice/Legends|spice]] from [[Kessel/Legends|Kessel]] to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], they were discovered by an [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial patrol]].

The [[Smuggler/Legends|Smuggler]] convinced the [[Imperials]] that he was taking the children to [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]]. Since the Captain [[Tybert Capucot]] insisted to escort them, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|Millennium Falcon]] dropped the children off at [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]], thus returning Cathea back to her homeplanet."

After retrieving the ship, she wished Cade well and asked him to say goodbye to Blue for her.

The Chiss were concerned that the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the Yuuzhan Vong might be in league and coordinating attacks against the [[Chiss Ascendancy/Legends|Chiss Ascendancy]].Despite her frequent clashes with Thrawn over the morality of his tactics, her duplicitous aid enabled the Force Commander to lure the Vagaari into a trap. After Mitth'raw'nuruodo successfully captured a Vagaari 'treasure' ship, she backed him in opposing the [[Chaf family/Legends|Chaf family]], who sought the spoils of war for their own ends. Syndic Mitth'ras'safis 'requested' her to look into the activities of Thrawn after the apparent loss of the ''Whirlwind'', yet she covertly allied herself with Thrawn again, lying to various members of the CEDF about Jorj Car'das when she 'forgave' Thrawn for allowing the 'spy' to escape. In this instance her concern for the safety of the Chiss overrode the strict codes of war forbidding preemptive strikes, as Car'das's escape was a lure designed by Thrawn for the purpose of capturing both the Vagaari and [[Outbound Flight Project]]. Ar'alani was even actively involved in the next phase of the operation; liberating the [[Geroon]] home world. While this may have been an entirely innocent gesture on her part, this is doubtful, as her absence allowed Thrawn to provide data on the Vong to [[Kinman Doriana]], in exchange for his loyalty and assistance in eliminating the Vagaari and the Outbound Flight."

Under Horn's tutelage she became a much better pilot; he was even able to get her to open up about her reclusiveness and found out that she had been taken advantage of by [[Remart Sasyru]], yet another Survivor pilot and nemesis of Idanian.Caet, along with Timmser, taunted Corran/Jenos about the fact that he was jealous about Leonia Tavira's favoring Sasyru instead of him, a point which Corran at first flatly denied. These taunts, however, coupled with the wise statements of the [[Caamasi]] [[Elegos A'Kla]] forced Corran into introspection, and ultimately allowed him to steer clear of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|Dark Side's]] temptations that Tavira embodied.When Corran terrorized the [[Courkrus]]'s hive of Invid pirate crews, she along with Timmser fled the planet in a [[Hyperdrive/Legends|hyperdrive]]-equipped [[Clutch (fighter)|Tri-fighter]]."

She instructed them to make their way through a tunnel in the well to meet up with her on the other side. Halla made her way to the opposite end of the tunnel, went down in it, but was then captured by the [[Coway]]. She was tied up and forced to watch Luke battle a Coway. When Luke won, Halla was released.She feasted with the Coway, but soon Luke sensed the Dark Lord's approach. The Coway and the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperials]] fought a fierce underground battle until the Coway won, and Halla traveled with Luke and Leia to find the crystal at the temple. There she took it and gave it to Luke, who, after defeating [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] and healing Leia's wounds, gave it back to her. She then left Mimban with Luke and Leia to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]], though not before admitting to Luke that rather than being a master of the Force, she was really a faker and a charlatan, capable of doing ""parlor tricks"" but little more."

Hoping to bring glory upon herself and her [[domain]], Elan accepted the mission.

Elan even hoped her actions could result in her father being promoted to the rank of [[Mosthigh priest]].The Yuuzhan Vong staged a small [[Battle near Exodo II|defeat]] close to [[Exodo II]] in which Elan and Vergere jettisoned from a ship in a small [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] and were subsequently apprehended by the light cruiser ''[[Soothfast]]'', where they requested [[Politics/Legends|political]] asylum.The defectors were transferred to [[Bagsho]] on [[Nim Drovis]] where they were taken into custody by Major [[Showolter]] of New Republic Intelligence.

Han boarded the shuttle to find everyone but the two of them dead. Elan suggested the Peace Brigade must have accidentally released the bioweapon themselves. Han grew progressively more suspicious as they escaped in the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']], and decided to load them into an escape pod and return them to their own people. Knowing her deception had failed, Elan attempted to use the bo'tous on him, but inadvertently became trapped in the escape pod with him.

Such was the extent of their dishonor that they formed a new den under a new name, since the old name had become an obscenity. Kleyvits strove to conceal this in order to achieve consensus among all Selonians. Selonians as a race are honest, or are at least unacquainted with deceit and confused by it. Kleyvits was unable to lie about their alliance, and even her keeping it secret brought with it great dishonor.When [[Dracmus]], acting as a Hunchuzuc Den representative, arrived on Selonia along with [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], [[Leia Organa Solo]], and [[Mara Jade Skywalker|Mara Jade]], negotiations began in earnest between the Overden and its opponents. Each side sought to prove that its point of view was inevitable and guide the other side into falling in line. Kleyvits gained the upper hand: her faction was larger, possessed the [[planetary repulsor]] on Selonia, and their call for independence from the New Republic resonated better with the Selonian psyche.Han, Leia, and Mara were kept as captives and questioned for a time, but together they reasoned that the Overden must have had outside help to control the repulsor.

Dracmus seized upon the opportunity and demanded to know, and the balance of power tipped as Kleyvits, exposed as fraudulent, cowered and admitted that her allies were the Selonians of the Triad.

Kateel of Kuhlvult,NaN,Female,Human,"Neelah worked as a dancing girl under [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]]. After his [[Death/Legends|death]], Neelah escaped from the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt's]] [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|palace]], earning herself a cut down her cheek from a [[Gamorrean/Legends|Gamorrean]] guard. During her trek away from the place of her bondage, Neelah stumbled across two medical droids on their way to a secret base where Dengar was treating the half-digested form of [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], his armor and skin almost all consumed by the [[Sarlacc/Legends|sarlacc's]] stomach acid. Knowing somehow that Boba Fett was connected to her past, she left him to recuperate, with strict orders that the droids not tell anyone that she had been there.Neelah knew nothing of her past due to a [[Memory wipe/Legends|mind-wipe]] which was ordered by her sister, [[Kodir of Kuhlvult]]. Her only semblance of self that she retained was her mindset that she had not always been a [[Slavery/Legends|slave]] to another being, but rather the other way around. Her haughty attitude made her believe that she had been born someone of higher stature. These thoughts she kept to herself during her enslavement. Though she watched other girls around her being cruelly mistreated by their bloated master, even occasionally used as [[Jabba's rancor|rancor]] food, her own health was kept intact. She felt that this treatment came from a bounty hunter who seemed to watch over and had caught her gaze a number of [[Time/Legends|times]]&amp;mdash;Boba Fett. His gaze always made fear crawl through her, but for a separate reason than his infamous reputation.When Dengar took in Boba Fett and started nursing him back to health, Neelah demanded that she be included in his recuperation, with Dengar reluctantly agreeing. When [[Kuat of Kuat]] discovered that Fett was still alive, he sent [[Bomb/Legends|bombers]] to [[Bombing of the Dune Sea|strafe]] the surface of [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], hoping to eliminate the bounty hunter once and for all. After the bombing, Fett knew that it was time to leave. Boba Fett took Dengar with him as a partner and also Neelah. She knew that she wasn't there beyond the fact that she had some part to play in Fett's mercenary schemes. During their flight in the [[Slave I/Legends|''Slave I'']] to an undisclosed location, Neelah persuaded Dengar to tell her the history of what had previously been happening with Boba Fett and his recent dealings. These happened to coincide with her erased past.During her flight, Neelah [[Slicer/Legends|hacked]] into Boba Fett's files and discovered a picture of an ancient symbol from [[Kuat/Legends|Kuat]]. That symbol brought the memories of her past flooding back. She knew her true name; Kateel of Kuhlvult, a member of the Kuat high lineage. She hid the fact that she knew who she was from both bounty hunters, unsure of what they would do if they found out.Their [[Starship/Legends|ship]] was eventually tracked down by Kateel's sister, Kodir of Kuhlvult, who took Kateel away from both Dengar and Boba Fett, and they put up no fight as Kateel left willingly. Kodir didn't realize that her sister knew who she was and the circumstances behind why her sister wanted her dead. When Kodir of Kuhlvult discovered that Kateel remembered everything from her past, she pulled out a blaster and was prepared to kill Kateel in order to silence her forever. Kateel, however, was far too quick. Kateel swiftly disarmed her sister, overwhelming Kodir's meager defense, and sent Kodir of Kuhlvult back to stand trial on Kuat. Kateel then reconnected with her heritage and, when Fett tracked her down, he threw out the idea to her that she could take control of [[Kuat Drive Yards/Legends|Kuat Drive Yards]] because of the [[Bombing of the Kuat shipyards (4 ABY)|former leader's death]].As the [[Chairman/Legends|chairman]] of KDY in [[8 ABY/Legends|8 ABY]], she was forced to surrender Kuat and its shipyards to the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]] during the [[Taking of Kuat]].&lt;ref name=""TEGTW"" /&gt;{{Char-stub}}"

Chrysalla,NaN,Female,NaN,"During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], she was a peasant living in the slums of the [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. When the last Satab came to power, he took notice of her and brought her back to his palace as his favored consort. After this, she enjoyed the lap of luxury and the benefits of being the chosen ward of the ruler of the planet. At some point, Chrysalla was being paraded through the streets of [[Goyoikin]] when an explosive flew through the air in an attempted [[Assassin/Legends|assassination]]. However, [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], who was in the general vicinity, was able to shoot the explosive out of the air. Chrysalla declared Solo a hero and brought him back to the palace to meet the [[Satab]].After a celebratory banquet in Solo's honor, the Satab insisted that Solo stay the night in the palace. However, Solo tried to escape the very same night, and it was only through Chrysalla's interference that Solo wasn't caught by the [[palace]] guard. Solo and Chrysalla spent the night together where she explained that the Satab had supernatural powers gifted to him by his possession of the [[shadeshine]].The next morning, Chrysalla followed the Satab and Solo to a [[Sansanna spice/Legends|sansanna spice]] [[Mining/Legends|mine]] where she overheard the Satab's intention to make Solo the next Satab. Knowing that the shadeshine had the ability to burn out and destroy a person's body, Chrysalla feared for Solo's safety. During the ceremony to ""promote"" Solo, Chrysalla intervened and kept him from touching the shadeshine and receiving its powers. In the ensuing chaos, the Satab attempted to force Solo to become the next Satab. However Chrysalla touched the stone before he could bend Solo to his will, and she became imbued with the powers of the shadeshine. The Satab and his mistress began to have a duel of the minds, but the effects of the shadeshine were quickly burning out the Satab's body. Running away from the battle, the Satab attempted to enter the [[Hall of Satabs]] to halt the deadly effects of the shadeshine. However, Solo was able to trip the powerful ruler, and he was unable to make it to his destination, incinerated by the power of the shadeshine.With the Satab defeated, Chrysalla was the only person to left with the powers of the shadeshine. To end the rule of the Satabs and the shadeshine, Chrysalla knew that she could not continue to wield their power. After sharing a parting kiss with Han Solo, she willingly brought herself and the stone into the Hall of Satabs where she was placed in suspended animation, ending the royal line. Around [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], the Hall of Satabs was still being maintained as a historic landmark by the [[Rov]] [[Vetter Piin]]. [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]] witnessed Chrysalla's body still perfectly preserved in the [[nullification chamber]] when they visited Ventooine during the search for [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]."

The evacuation was due to a deadly toxin that had spread throughout the planet because of a weapons chemical leak. Antana and the other Jedi later discovered that the toxic leak was connected with the local [[Avoni]] raiders.

Rynalla,NaN,Female,Human,"A [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|female]], Rynalla was a scholar affiliated with the department of ancient history of the prestigious [[University of Sanbra]]. She was an expert in [[The galaxy/Legends|galactic]] history, archaeology, and the lore of several traditions of [[The Force/Legends|Force]]-users, including the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]], the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], in addition to bygone organizations. Secretly, Rynalla researched the Sith and traditions of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] to increase her own [[Force power/Legends|powerss]] of the Force.While researching in the University records, Rynalla discovered that a missing [[Sith artifact/Legends|Sith treasure]], the [[Bracers of Najus]], had been lost in a Sith starship which had crash-landed on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] of [[Leritor/Legends|Leritor]]. The Bracers could be used to increase the power of the dark side, and she coveted the relic. She hired two dozen [[Klatooinian/Legends|Klatooinian]] [[Soldier/Legends|soldiers]] and went to Leritor in her bulk freighter, with her two [[PTR-3 Vedette]] snub fighters in tow. On arrival, Rynalla found the Sith starship half-buried in the local mountain range known as the [[Bleaks]]; she quickly organized a dig site using prefabricated buildings. Noticing two main groups in the planet, the Human settlers who farmed the inland prairies and the native [[Sauvax]] living the coast, she decided to capture strong individuals from each group and use them as slave miners to uncover the ship.Rynalla's forces raided one of the massive harvester machines used by the farmers, the nearby ''[[Nellist]]''. The stronger colonists were captured and the weaker ones were murdered with the traditional Sauvax weapon, the [[gruush]], so that other on-world Humans would blame the Sauvax, even if a more detailed analysis would have proved otherwise. Similarly, the Klatooinians also assaulted a Sauvax community, called a [[kuuvan]], again executing the feeble and conscripting the powerful. They used [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], so that the Sauvax in other kuuvans would suspect that the Human farmers were behind the incursion. Thus Rynalla manufactured a war among the Sauvax and the farmers, keeping them busy while she plundered her prize.In all, fifty Human and Sauvax prisoners were captured. They were put to work, with the amphibious Sauvax in the deepest submerged decks of the ship, and always watched by armed Klatooinians. Rynalla did not tell the captives what she was looking for, but every two [[Standard day/Legends|days]], she evicted the exhausted laborers while she looked for the Bracers and the Klatooinians looked for any attempt to create an escape tunnel. Rynalla's disposal of waste polluted a nearby river, a change that was being noticed by several local Sauvax. She was certain, however, that nobody would imagine that she'd created a slave camp. More worried about fugitives than intruders, Rynalla organized a second, smaller camp near the edge of the mountain, to stop and execute any runaways; five such individuals met their end there.A Sauvax kuuvan led by [[Unidentified tevelor|their tevelor]], mistakenly believing that the farmers intended to [[Speciecide|exterminate]] their [[Species/Legends|species]], surrounded the combine-reaper ''[[Gevion]]'' and demanded an explanation. As the farmers believed that the Sauvax were an aggressive, murderous species, they were too wary to send an envoy; in a stalemate, the Sauvax refused to allow the ''Gevion'' collect its crop. This situation would have escalated into war, but a group of offworlders heard a [[Distress signal/Legends|distress call]] from the ''Gevion'' and offered to mediate. These individuals began investigating and soon found a trail to Rynalla's camp. Rynalla found the Bracers of Najus just in time to face the intruders. She was eventually defeated, however, and peace was restored to Leritor."

Tyanna Tymb,NaN,Female,Sullustan,"Tyanna moved through the [[SoroSuub Business Academy]] at [[Lightspeed/Legends|lightspeed]], and graduated at the top of her class with a bright career ahead of her. Early on she had displayed qualities that would make her the scourge of the corporate community: She used every dirty trick and scare tactic in the SoroSuub datajournal to discredit and eliminate fellow students that were possible competitors, though she made sure that everything she did was perfectly legal and was considered fair by the Academy's hierarchy.However, there was one student which Tyanna just couldn't shake, and she haunted the Sullustan through every semester. They remained in a dead heat as they were coming up to the final tests for graduation, and it was anyone's guess who would win the battle for position and the department placement. What Tyanna found worse, however, was the fact that her opponent, [[Alara Fax]], was not even a Sullustan but a [[Human/Legends|Human]]. To lose to a Human in the theater of Sullustan business would be a major disgrace in her mind. So rather than use her traditional methods which had already failed to out Fax, Tyanna instead befriended her and learned everything she could about the Human, then waited to make her move until there were only a few days left at the Academy.She had found out about the one weakness she had that frustrated Alara to no end; despite being able to negotiate a multi-digit deal better than almost anyone, the intricacies of the Sullustan ""marketing tri-icosahedra"" theory eluded her no matter how much she studied the textdocs. Tyanna, pretending to want to help her with this problem, offered Alara a data card study aid shortly before the final test came. Hidden in the programming of the card, however, were the actual answers to the tests questions. When the exam started, the hidden programming kicked in and the answers started scrolling across the data pad. Caught supposedly cheating, Alara was expelled from the Academy on the eve of her graduation, and Tyanna's primary opponent was effectively removed from the playing field.Since her graduation, Tyanna continued to advance quickly. When she was a junior executive, she started striking major deals for SoroSuub and earning them major amounts of [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] almost immediately. It wasn't long before the home office decided to use her in the field. In [[2 ABY/Legends|2 ABY]], in the height of the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], she was assigned the Top OpEx position to handle the SoroSuub facilities in the [[Varada system]].Though her people threw their support into the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], Tyanna herself had always favored the methods and vast resources held by the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. She continued to trade with the remnants of the Empire after the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], simply in a less-visible fashion than before. She had an especially close relationship with [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] [[Poliff]] of the [[Tunka sector]] and with [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Fessix]] of the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] [[Discord (Star Destroyer)|''Discord'']]. She regularly provided these two individuals with details concerning her Republic customers.A rival from her past, Alara Fax, returned to compete with her in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. When Tyanna purchased the resource and trade rights to the seventh system in the Varada sector, she found one planet and the neighboring [[Asteroid/Legends|asteroid]] field already under contract to the company which Fax had created, [[Fax Ventures]]. For the sake of completeness, and to again beat her rival, Tyanna wanted the corporate rights to the entire system, never mind the rich deposits of [[Aluminite]] and [[Corax Ore]] waiting to be extracted from the asteroids or the lush jungles of [[Bestal Three]] ripe for exploitation. Her goal was to take away Alara's new toy, no matter what methods she had to use. She immediately began scanning textdocs and sending spies to infiltrate Alara's headquarters, though it is not known if she succeeded or not."

She saw the Cartel cutting down [[ch'hala tree]]s with her own eyes and even got hold of a holorecording of their crime - but she knew that, should she try to make it public, the Cartel would say it was a doctored image. She considered the Cartel to be as bad as the [[Trade Federation of Planets|Trade Federation]], although she had never seen the Federation in action.&lt;ref name=""TRW"" /&gt;Gerta decided to disappear with a few other people from [[Gadrin]] and Hedrett, and form a [[Cularin resistance]] to oppose the Cartel. She emptied her house and traveled to their new base, the [[Cloud Mountain mines]]. Many people, including Wahl, ""disappeared"" like her in the following days, enough to cause a disturbance in [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] that was detected by Jedi Master [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]].&lt;ref name=""TRW"" /&gt;Gerta became the informal leader of the resistance, with [[Nim'Ri]] and [[Broof Yurdel]] as her chief advisers. She wanted to avoid bloodshed, and was adamant that the resistance would not be the first to initiate deadly force.&lt;ref name=""TRW"" /&gt;Independent gents sent by Master Qel-Bertuk eventually found the resistance base. Haman, Nim'Ri and Yurdel met with them and tried to convince them not to reveal anything about the resistance.&lt;ref name=""TRW"" /&gt;One month later, Haman decided to look for some secret files of the Cartel, specifically reports on how they get their charter for Cularin and their account records of that time, which would specify which Cularin officers were bribed. She obtained speeders for the escape and an advanced, highly-modified datapad (probably a work by famed slicer [[Baylan]]) to extract information from the Cartel's computers, but she also needed someone from outside the resistance to approach the local [[Metatheran Cartel operations office]] in Gadrin. She then asked one of the members of the resistance, [[Corporal/Legends|Corporal]] [[Ortin]] from [[OPS]], to organize a secret meeting with those independent agents at the [[OPS third sector precinct house]]. Haman returned to the secret base of Cloud Mountain mines using a secret way.&lt;ref name=""ARv""&gt;''[[A Revelation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;The operation was a success and the agents went to the mines to give Haman the information. However, some verification file codes were missing, but she discovered they were only available in the well-protected [[Metatheran Cartel jungle base]]. She asked Broof Yurdel and his troops to prepare a raid, and offered the independent agents to cooperate with Yurdel. Noticing that Yurdel was too happy with the assignment, she specifically ordered him to set the weapons in stun. She also asked Kris Wahl to question the independent agents to obtain any information they might have about the jungle base, as they had been previously there.&lt;ref name=""ARv"" /&gt;However, the Cartel was tracking the stolen data, and a Cartel-aligned [[Caarite]] force attacked the resistance's secret headquarters. Haman was trapped in the crossfire, but she nevertheless tried to reach her companions. She was then shot in her back and severely wounded. Only the quick actions of some allies of the resistance saved her life.&lt;ref name=""ARv"" /&gt;Due to Haman's critical state, Yurdel was even less prone to use non-lethal force; nevertheless he ordered his troops to set weapons in stun, as it was what Haman would have wanted. Haman did not take part in the following raid against the jungle base, which was a success and led to the Cartel retiring from Cualrin. Soon afterward, governor [[Barnab Chistor]] of Gadrin decorated Haman and the other resistance leaders for their success.&lt;ref name=""ARv"" /&gt;Later, Haman traveled to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] to meet with Senator [[Lavinia Wren]].

When she was very young, her mother killed her father, beginning a resentment which would last the rest of her life. Quietly plotting her revenge, Ros used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Metamorphosis|transform her appearance]]. Because of her disguise as a hideously deformed old hag, the other women of the clan called her ""'''the [[Rancor/Legends|Rancor]]'''"". All the Nightsisters on Dathomir believed that Ros Lai was crippled and therefore abused her. Even her mother would mock her. Later, however, she came out when she was watched by [[Vonya]], [[Yani]] and [[Leela]], as she transformed back into her true form. Ros Lai killed Leela when she asked for forgiveness, but she declared that none of them could ever forgive. Yani fled and left Vonya alone with Ros Lai. Ros wasn't strong enough to face Vonya who almost killed her in a fight. It was in this capacity that she discovered [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]], who was posing as a slave to investigate a plot by Lai's mother to reawaken the ancient power of the [[Infinity Gate]].[[File:Rosa lai metamorphosis.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Ros Lai metamorphsises to her true form.]]Ros Lai ran towards the [[Yag Shushin's star cruiser|star cruiser]] that belonged to [[Yag Shushin]].

Therefore, Ros Lai infused him with some of her witch's blood due to having [[Force healing/Legends|healing properties]]. Then they flew in the direction of the Infinity Gate, where Zalem was already using the super weapon to destroy the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] capital world of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]. During their journey, they were discovered and shot by Vonya. Yag intercepted the shot that was supposed to kill Ros Lai and Quinlan Vos and died. Subsequently, their ship fired on Vonya and destroyed it, so they could go to Zalem to the stellar control station of the gate.In order to gain Zalem's confidence, Lai stabbed Quinlan Vos with her fire blade, but in reality, it was just an illusion so that Quinlan was not killed. Instead, Lai was successful in killing Zalem, thus fulfilling her quest in avenging her father's death. With Zalem out of the picture, Ros Lai assumed the mantle as leader of the Nightsisters and ordered them to kill Quinlan for good. However, this triggered a mechanism and killed the Nightsisters, only leaving Ros Lai to be stunned. Quinlan reversed the weapon, destroying the Infinity Gate itself. He fled with Ros Lai in Yag's starship to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] where she was taken into custody. His reason to have Ros Lai alive was that he felt that there was good in her.In [[28 BBY/Legends|28 BBY]] she self-published her memoirs, though people didn't believe her story at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force (real-life book)|''Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force'']]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:RosLai-TCWJA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ros Lai during the Clone Wars]]During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Ros Lai left the Jedi important information that helped the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in their fight against the Nightsister's alliance with [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], leader of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].

Gyla Petro,NaN,Female,Human,"Gyla Petro was a born into the aristocratic family [[House Petro]]. At some point she became a member of [[New Worlds]] as a biologist. Some of these biologists along with some imperial soldiers traveled to the planet [[Kashyyyk/Legends|Kashyyyk]] in order to obtain some roots of the [[Orga/Legends|Orga]] plant. When the soldiers started to destroy plants to make a pathway through the forest, the plants got upset and started killing all the imperials. Gyla was the only survivor due to the intervention of [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]]. After being saved, Gyla was taken to a [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiee]] city on the back of a [[Sureggi/Legends|Sureggi]] and participated in the celebration of [[Life Day/Legends|Life Day]]. However, shortly afterwards, Solo ended up captured by Imperials and forced to descend to the lowest and foulest level of Kashyyyk, which led to suspicion of Petro being an Imperial spy.Sometime later, Gyla was traveling aboard the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] with Han Solo and Chewbacca. Han received as SOS message from [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and found the droids [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] in the wreckage of Luke's ship. Upset at the detour, Gyla noted that she didn't ask to join a mission of mercy. C-3PO explained Luke's mission to Han and Gyla became more upset. She thought Han was just a smuggler and not a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]]. Gyla wanted to leave when Han piloted the ship away from imperial forces, though she had no choice but to come along for the ride. As the ''Millennium Falcon'' escaped Imperial forces by going through [[Constancia/Legends|Constancia's]] ring, Gyla continued to beg to be let go. Han escaped from the Imperials and piloted the ship into a hidden base inside the ring. Once landed, Han got off to investigate while Gyla stayed aboard. Luke, [[Gamine]] and [[Sharlee]] were at this base and once it was deemed safe, Gyla came off the ship. Everyone devised a strategy to get Gamine to the surface of the planet. Han would go with Sharlee and hijack a [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE Fighter]] while Gyla, Luke, Gamine, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO would fly towards the surface in the ''Millennium Falcon''. The distraction worked and once the Falcon made it to the surface, they were all celebrated as heroes.Petro's suspected status of espionage for the Empire was later included in [[Gyla Petro (file)|her files]] on the planet [[Fusai/Legends|Fusai]], specifically on the Rebel-owned [[BRT supercomputer]] [[Mistress Mnemos]], although Mnemos was unaware of the exact details behind why she was suspected as being a spy."

Kendle,NaN,Female,NaN,"Kendle was born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Iskalon/Legends|Iskalon]], and she eventually fell in love with and married [[Mone]], a fellow [[Iskalonian]] and the son of [[Primor (Inleshat)|Primor]], the leader of the School. Kendle cared deeply for her husband and father-in-law and resolved to keep them safe no matter the cost. When the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] came to the [[Iskalon system]] and began to subjugate the neighboring worlds of [[Gamandar]] and [[Telfrey]], Kendle feared for the fate of her world and decided to aide the Empire in order to protect her family from the same type of destruction. When the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] heroes [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]], [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], [[Chewbacca/Legends|Chewbacca]], and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] arrived on Iskalon to open negotiations with the School, Kendle subsequently opened communication with [[Admiral/Legends|Admiral]] [[Griggor Tower]], the head of the Imperial operation on Gamandar.Kendle told Tower of the presence of the Rebels, and then manipulated the Rebels by dropping hints that what they sought was located on Gamandar. Calrissian and Chewbacca decided to follow up on the tip, but they also brought Kendle's husband, Mone with them. Kendle must have believed that the Imperials would not harm her beloved when the Rebels were in their grasp, and so she made no attempt to stop Mone from going with them. After watching the Rebels depart, Kendle contacted Tower again and told him about the two remaining Rebels that had decided to explore the underwater city of [[Pavillion]]. Unfortunately for Kendle, during this communication, another Iskalonian, [[Kiro]] overheard her selling the Rebels out to the Empire. Kiro was a firm supporter of rebellion against the Empire after they had slaughtered a delegation of Iskalonians who had tried to sue for peace.Kiro grappled with Kendle, trying to kill the traitor, but the attempt ended up smashing both of their [[Water tank|water helmets]] which allowed them to enter Pavillion. Kiro was forced to abandon his attempt so that he could rush back to the ocean, but Kendle was badly hurt and unable to move. As Kendle began to suffocate without her water helmet, Luke, Leia, and Primor happened to spot Kendle's plight. Luke and Leia rushed to enter the city and aid Kendle while Primor watched anxiously. The two rebels reached the struggling Iskalonian, but it seemed that they would be too late to save her. However, unknown to the group, Kendle's leaked information to Admiral Tower had caused him to make a rash decision. An interplanetary missile had been fired at the city of Pavillion in hopes of killing Leia and Luke.The massive explosion of the missile caused an enormous [[Iskalon effect|tidal wave]] which smashed against Pavillion and destroyed the underwater city. Luckily for Kendle, Pavillion's destruction let in an inrush of water, and she was saved from suffocating. After coming back to her senses, Kendle saw the two Rebels struggling to escape the wreckage of the city to reach the surface. Angry that the Imperials had gone to such measures to see them both destroyed, Kendle tried to lead them astray in an attempt to drown them. However, Kiro once again appeared and tried to execute the traitor. Kendle was forced to flee the scene, allowing the two Rebels to eventually reach the surface.Back on the surface, Kendle witnessed the carnage that had come about because of her actions. Many Iskalonians had died in the attack, including her beloved father-in-law. Kendle tried to pay her respects by grieving over Primor's lifeless body, but Kiro once again appeared in close pursuit. Kendle ran from the scene, but soon returned with members of the School in another attempt to destroy the two Rebels. Kendle declared herself as the new leader of the School following Primor's death and accused the Rebels of bringing this terrible catastrophe to her world. The School began to attack the Rebels and Kiro, but the three were able to fight off the assault. However, the School continued to push and it seemed that Kendle would soon be victorious. Unfortunately for Kendle's plans, just as her group moved in for the kill, a wild [[Chiaki]] arose from the depths. As everyone scattered from the area, the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] arrived and slew the creature. As the monstrous serpent gave its last breath, it began to topple onto the battleground, and its dead body smashed directly on top of Kendle, killing her instantly.The ''Millennium Falcon'' landed immediately afterward, and Mone left the vessel, distraught over his wife's death and betrayal. Mone declared himself the new leader of the School, and bitter over the loss of his family, he declared that the School would no longer deal with air breathers due to the pain that they had caused. The Rebels were forced to leave Iskalon, and the School departed the wreckage of Pavillion."

She sat upon [[Khoonda]], a government tasked with protecting the settlers and regulating their day-to-day affairs&amp;mdash;a task formerly entrusted to the Jedi&amp;mdash;and was proclaimed the Administrator.Realizing that the [[Khoonda Militia|militia corps]] alone was not enough to ensure Khoonda's safety, Adare secretly maintained contacts with Jedi Master [[Vrook Lamar]], a former member of the [[Dantooine Enclave Council]] and a friend for many years. Unlike most settlers, she trusted the Jedi, remembering the good they had done when the Enclave had stood firmly. However, she understood that the Jedi in general had an extremely bad reputation on Dantooine, and even she could do nothing about it.The opportunity to change that fact came in [[3951 BBY]], the year when relations between the settlers and [[Azkul]]'s [[Exchange]] mercenaries grew especially tense. Unbeknownst to Adare, the mercenaries captured Vrook, preparing to transport him to [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]] to claim [[G0-T0|Goto's]] bounty. It was at this time that [[Meetra Surik]] arrived on Dantooine, looking for Vrook, and the Administrator granted her the permission to search the ruins of the Enclave. In turn, Surik agreed to help the settlers in any way possible.Eventually, the Exile's investigation, during which Master Vrook was freed from the mercenaries, triggered an open conflict between them and Khoonda, leading to the [[Battle of Khoonda]], when the mercenaries attempted to infiltrate Khoonda and kill Adare. During the conflict, Surik significantly contributed to the defenses of Khoonda and, along with Vrook, bravely fought the mercenaries, restoring the settlers' faith in the Jedi.After the battle, as Dantooine's safe and prosperous future was secured, Adare did her best to ensure that the deeds of Vrook and Surik, and the heritage of the Jedi, would not be forgotten."

When [[Jedi Master/Legends|Masters]] K'Kruhk and [[Sian Jeisel]] arrived with their clone troopers, [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]] was issued. Several of the younglings were [[Massacre on Bogden 3|killed]] as [[Du Mahn]] defended them. Mahn was shot down by the clones, and Jeisel sacrificed herself to cover their escape.

Lumbra grabbed Seddwia by the arm and pulled her away. Immediately, Piru jumped to her rescue. Unfortunately, Piru was shot by one of Lumbra's men. Lumbra soon realized that the children were Jedi and decided to turn them in to the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Empire]]. The children were chained up and taken away. It was only due to the skills of K'Kruhk and Chase Piru that the younglings were freed and Lumbra was killed.Seddwia traveled with the rest of the group to the planet [[Arkinnea]] in search of a new home.

After two decades, Constanten passed the [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]] and was given the rank of Knight within the Jedi Order. Returning to the Almas Academy where she studied to become a [[Jedi Guardian]], the Tarasin woman befriended the [[Skrilling/Legends|Skrilling]] Jedi [[Valiri]] and the two worked together on many missions. A respected woman among the Jedi at the academy, Constanten was known for her intense courage in battle, like to that of fellow Jedi [[K'kur]]. This fact contributed to the surprise many felt when she refused to respond to the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council's]] call to arms when the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] erupted in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]] between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Invoking the [[Right of Denial]], Constanten refused a rank within the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]; instead remaining on Almas performing her usual duties. Assigned to protect the [[Almas Sith fortress|fortress]] of long dead [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Rivan]], Constanten was joined by five other Knights in guarding the structure's entrances while a large research party entered its depths. Standing guard at the fortress' south entrance with Knights K'kur and Valiri beside her, the group prepared to defend against any attacks from the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] sect known as the [[Believers]].&lt;ref name=""AMA"" /&gt;While the group waited outside the fortress, a sandstorm swept across the area, plunging the structure into a dismal gloom. During the storm, [[Dark Side Adept|dark side adept]] [[Phylus Mon]] led a group of raiders, including a giant Force-sensitive [[Wampa/Legends|Wampa]] in an attack on the ancient Sith edifice. While most of the Jedi guards were killed, Constanten and Valiri were merely wounded, and thus taken captive by the dark siders. Deep in the fortress, Adept Mon and his followers preformed a Sith ritual, planning on enslaving the two prisoners and several volunteers and transforming them into [[Sith battlelord]]s. The ritual went wrong however, ripping the participants' very Force-essence from their bodies and bonding them with a crystal that Mon quickly confiscated and took with the fleeing raiders. Long after the ritual had ended, Jedi search teams happened upon the bodies of the sacrificial men and women and took them back to the academy for further analysis. There, [[Jedi Lore Keeper|Jedi librarian]] [[Oden Malksch]] accidentally possessed the body of [[Karae Nalvas]], discovering where Mon's secret headquarters was during the experience. Reporting back to headmaster [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]], the Jedi sent a team to find and destroy the crystal in hopes that the Force-essences would then return to their respective bodies.&lt;ref name=""AMA"" /&gt;"

Gorak (Trandoshan),NaN,Female,Trandoshan,"Gorak did not recall her first years. She knew she was raised as a slave in a starship and mocked by [[Wookiee/Legends|Wookiees]] for being short, pink-eyed and specially for being albino. Apparently she was rented for a week by a huge Wookiee, but she could not recall what happened. At that time, she was also regularly beaten, which served to increase her skin's hardness.After some years, she became a stout, albeit still short, young adult. She was big enough to become a threat. Although she was still a slave, she was no longer mocked.Eventually Gorak was freed, and she met slaver [[Phylus Mon]]. Phylus Mon offered Gorak a job at his zoo, food and clothes, as well as a sense of importance. However, upon hiring her, Phylus Mon injected an explosive near Gorak's heart. The device would kill Gorak should Phylus Mon die for any reason. The bomb could be deactivated if hit by an ion weapon, but Phylus Mon did not allow any ion weapon in his ship, the ''[[Animiasma]]''. This mechanism was a security measure that Phylus Mon used in every one of his slaves. At the same time, Phylus Mon paid his slaves and insisted in calling them employees - but at the same time, all of them knew they could not leave his service or they would die.Phylus Mon was a hunter and he also dealt in huge animals.

It was Flarestream's first [[Time/Legends|time]] in command.&lt;ref name=""CRO"" /&gt;The plan was simple and familiar; Flarestream and her [[Pilot/Legends|pilots]] were to [[Space warfare|engage]] and delay the Imperial force&amp;mdash;which consisted of a line [[Cruiser/Legends|cruiser]] and [[TIE/LN starfighter]] support&amp;mdash;long enough for the freighters and [[Troop transport/Legends|troop transports]] to escape into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]]. The starfighters were not expected to defeat the Imperials, but to survive long enough to accomplish the mission and withdraw. Standard tactics were to deploy in a picket line, forcing the enemy fighters to pass through their formation to attack the fleeing [[Starship/Legends|starships]]. However, Flarestream had other ideas. The TIE/LN starfighter had become the standard Imperial fighter, and since its deployment, average Alliance losses during a retreat had risen sharply. Alliance tacticians expected to [[Death/Legends|lose]] between 60 to 70 percent of their starfighter forces and 30 percent of their transports during a withdrawal. Faced with that information, Flarestream decided that she did not like those kind of odds.&lt;ref name=""CRO"" /&gt;Flarestream deployed her starfighters in an [[over-under formation]]. Visually, it looked the same as a picket line to incoming forces but had one crucial difference; one [[Fighter wing/Legends|wing]] of ships would be in advance of the other, allowing the second wing to jump the TIE starfighters while they were engaged with the first wing. The TIEs assaulted the apparent picket line high and hard, striking the first group of Alliance fighters. When the first line began taking evasive action, the second Alliance fighter group struck. The Imperial starfighters, caught in a trap, were systemically destroyed by the older Rebel craft.

Alara Fax,NaN,Female,Human,"Alara was one of only a handful of non-[[Sullustan/Legends|Sullustans]] to be admitted into the [[SoroSuub Business Academy]], and her future as a wheeler-dealer looked assured until she met [[Tyanna Tymb]]. Tyanna considered Alara her primary opponent for the top position of the year and would stop at absolutely nothing to eliminate her legally. At first Tyanna could do nothing to shake Alara no matter how hard she tried. So, instead of her usual means of using tricks and scare tactics, Tyanna befriended Alara in order to learn everything she could.Alara did in fact have one weakness, which Tyanna learned about in her time posing as a friend. No matter how hard she tried, despite the fact that she was better than anyone at negotiating multi-digit deals, Alara simply could not grasp the Sullustan marketing [[tri-icosahedra theory]]. With the pretense of helping Alara, Tymb gave her a [[Datacard/Legends|data card]] as a study aid. Hidden within this datacard, however, were the answers to the final test.When the final test came around, the hidden programming kicked in and the answers started scrolling across the screen. She was immediately accused of cheating and, with no evidence to prove that Tyanna had set her up and knowing that to say so would look like she was simply trying to shift the blame, Alara accepted the ruling of the Academy and left without her certificate of graduation or any hope of finding employment in the massive [[SoroSuub Corporation/Legends|SoroSuub Corporation]].Despite her weakness in the Sullustan marketing theory, Alara learned much in the Business Academy. In addition to the knowledge she gained in her lessons, she also learned that friendship is the safest place to hide deceit. It was a lesson she would not soon forget, and she became determined to excel beyond anything that Tyanna was capable of achieving. While Tyanna was not naturally outgoing and friendly, Alara was charming and engaging without even trying to be. She chose to use friendship as a tool and weapon, wielding it with grace and expertise that Tyanna could only envy.Because she had a disgrace as significant as being expelled from the SoroSuub Academy on her record, few legitimate corporations would even grant her an interview, let alone hire her into a position of responsibility and authority. Instead, Alara chose to enter into the fringe enterprises, working with people such as [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba]] the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]], [[Talon Karrde]], [[Ploovo Two-For-One/Legends|Ploovo Two-For-One]], and [[Stridus Darkov]] who were more than happy to get someone of her caliber in their organizations. Her longest association was in Stridus's organization, where she used his trust, friendship, and [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] to bankroll her own private endeavors until she had the means to strike out on her own. It was then that she founded [[Fax Ventures]].She owned several successful investments and operations throughout the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]], and started to gather the resources to expand her influence in a new direction. From the moment she left [[Sullust/Legends|Sullust]], Alara continued to track Tyanna's progress. She managed to determine where SoroSuub were going to send Tyanna even before the executives committed decisions to data pads. She determined that the only logical place for someone with Tyanna's talents and ambitions were in the field, in a region marginally under SoroSuub control but with much of room for potential expansion. Alara guessed, rightly so, that the place would be the [[Varada system]] and so, six months ahead of when Tyanna got the promotion, Alara began to plan her own expansions into the area.Alara also knew that Tyanna would not be able to settle for simply a single system, but would want to expand her influence throughout the entire [[Varada sector]]. With that in mind, she began to study the [[Sector/Legends|sector's]] seven systems, searching for some credit-making endeavor of galactic proportions to sink her business teeth into. Not only would such an endeavor make her company even more successful, it would also be her first step toward revenge on Tyanna. Luckily, she found just the hidden gold mine she had been looking for in the form of the planet [[Bestal Three]] and its nearby [[Kadal Asteroid Field]]. Before Tyanna and the SoroSuub Corporation could purchase the trade and resource right to them, Fax Ventures stepped in and bought them.To all outward appearances, Fax Ventures were using Bestal Three to process the [[Aluminite]] and [[Corax Ore]] mined from the Kadal Asteroid Field. While this was a good cover, and the mining was certainly earning Alara a substantial amount of credits, the real wealth lay in the jungles of Bestal Three. This was the only known location for the [[Vortal Tree]], the crusty seeds of which could be used for medicinal purposes to create even more effective [[Medpac/Legends|medpacs]]. Alara started the production of these medpacs in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], putting her into direct competition with SoroSuub. She knew that this would hurt Tyanna's pride to no end, and was hoping it would even disgrace her in the eyes of her SoroSuub superiors."

[[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]] ordered her to remove all traces of the ship from the records, and that nobody had seen it, it hadn't docked, and for most purposes, the sphere did not exist.

It was Tebut who discovered that the Jedi had placed a tracking beacon on the cloak that Darth Caedus, once Jacen Solo, had been wearing. While upset that he had allowed the Jedi to plant a tracer on his cloak, Caedus was pleased with Tebut's performance, and ordered the ship's Captain [[Kral Nevil]] to place a commendation in her permanent record.A short time later, the ''Anakin Solo'' encountered General [[Tycho Celchu]]'s shuttle, apparently being chased by a squadron of [[Confederation]] X-Wings. The shuttle broadcast all the correct identification codes and passwords, and Tebut allowed the shuttle to land. What she did not know was that General Celchu was not on board the shuttle, instead a strike team consisting of Jedi and their allies were on board. The Jedi infiltrated the ''Anakin Solo'', and were able to successfully rescue [[Tenel Ka Djo|Tenel Ka's]] daughter [[Allana Solo|Allana]] from the ship.After the Jedi had departed, Darth Caedus returned to the bridge and demanded to know who had allowed the shuttle to dock.

Caedus, however, disagreed and began [[Telekinesis/Legends#Force Choke|choking]] her with the Force. Captain Nevil attempted to stop him, only to be telekinetically hurled against a bulkhead. In her last moments, Tebut protested her loyalty to Caedus, but only succeeded in enraging him to the point where he was literally seeing red.

Tanquar initially agreed to allow Faniel to stay, but he was interrupted by [[Imperial Knight]] [[Treis Sinde]], who was aiding the Rangers. Sinde would not allow the refugees to stay at the base, as they had no extra food for them and the increased presence of Mon Calamari might inadvertently reveal the secret base to the Empire.

Before her departure, Sinde suggested that she make her way towards [[Soheras Trench]], a crevasse that the Rangers had used to hide their presence when tracking the ''Sea Lion''.

But the things changed when a gang of [[Slaver/Legends|slavers]] moved in and made the town its headquarters, resulting in most of the businesses failing &amp;ndash; Ember's included. Ember wanted to clear the town of the gang and to restore it to what it once was. To do so, she posted an ad in a [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] on [[Cato Neimoidia/Legends|Cato Neimoidia]], where off-record jobs were posted. Several individuals tried to acquire the job, including a [[Chistori]] thug and a young [[Human/Legends|Human]] male, but it was former [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Dass Jennir]] who proved to be able to perform the job. Ember left him some advance [[Galactic Credit Standard|credits]] and the [[Datachip/Legends|datachip]] with coordinates of the city and agreed to meet him there in two weeks since their first meeting.When Jennir arrived on Telerath he found out that the slavers led by a [[Chagrian/Legends|Chagrian]] named [[Musori]] wasn't the only gang in the town &amp;ndash; the second one was a [[Spice/Legends|spice]] running gang led by a couple of [[T'surr (species)|T'surr]] and the two gangs were constantly after each other. After learning about that, Jennir realized that his employer told him only half the truth. In fact, Chankeli hired Jennir to take care of the slavers in order to make space for the spice runners.In the middle of the night, while Jennir was attending to [[Dado]], who lost his right hand attempting to join Musori's gang through their head enforcer [[Mors Demanna]], Ember slipped away to inform the spice gang leader, [[Ken-Kiba]], of her beliefs that Jennir can be easily manipulated; on the side, she also brought Ken-Kiba a sentient slave for him.However, while she was out, Jennir made it to Telerath's second moon, where he freed the slaves from [[Ken-Giree]], Ken-Kiba's brother and pinned his death on the slavers.[[File:Ember Chankeli.jpg|left|thumb|Ember Chankeli on [[Cato Neimoidia/Legends|Cato Neimoidia]].]]The next morning, Ember returned to her inn to inquire if Jennir had had his breakfast. When [[Tam (female)|Tam]] said that he wasn't in his room the last time she checked, Ember let out her fury at [[Nikollane]], who was more occupied with her son, before she saw Jennir walking with [[Mors Demanna]]; she commented: ""This is going better than expected"". Ember later guessed that he must have been recruited into Musori's gang. Nikollane voiced her opinion that Jennir shouldn't be running around with the people who harmed her son, which resulted in Ember striking her. She threatened to sell both her to the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]] and dump her son into a canal if either of them interfered in her plans.[[File:PrinePirates.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ember Chankeli is captured by [[Unidentified slaver caravan|slavers]] on [[Prine]].]]Later, Jennir returned to Ember's inn, announcing that the gang problems would be resolved. Then suddenly, Jennir rushed off after Nikollane informed him that Dado intended to rat him out to Musori. A suspicious Ember then demanded answers from Nikollane. Ember then went to Ken-Kiba, who was in the midst of a gang war with Musori, and brought him and his gang back to her inn, where Jennir was about to urge her slaves to leave. As Ken-Kiba began to avenge himself upon Jennir, Nikollane activated the inn's trapdoor to enable him to escape. Enraged, Ken-Kiba had Ember and all her slaves locked up, determining that it was in fact she was manipulating ''him'', not Jennir.After suffering at the hands of the spicers, Ember was [[Skirmish on Telerath|rescued]] by Jennir after a showdown with Demanna, and she followed Jennir as he made his way to finish the battle with Ken-Kiba and his followers.[[File:H2TakesaBlasterBoltforEmber.jpg|thumb|left|[[H2]] saves Ember Chankeli on [[Prine]].]]The events damaged Chankeli's reputation, so it seemed impossible for her to continue in her old life. She asked Jennir that she would be allowed to accompany him on his travels. After this was agreed, the two broke into the direction on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Vondarc/Legends|Vondarc]] where Chankeli wanted to visit her family. During the flight, they were attacked by Imperials, after which they crashed on the barren wasteland of the planet [[Prine]]. In search of civilization, Chankeli confessed to her Jedi companion that she had no family at all on Vondarc, but this merely was a pretext to accompany him on his journeys. When they were both separated, Chankeli was kidnapped by a group of slave traders.While Jennir was following the caravan of slavers, he was being followed by [[Falco Sang]], a bounty hunter hired by the family of [[Dezono Qua]] to avenge his death at Jennir's hand. Eventually, both Jennir and Sang caught up with the slavers, and while the Jedi attempted to rescue Ember, the bounty hunter watched for a chance to kill him. He shot the repulsor on the transport carrying Ember and a young girl named [[Maddie]], causing Ember to fall off. She told Jennir to leave, and after he left with Maddie, the bounty hunter apprehended her and let the surviving slavers leave.Ember suggested that they work together to capture the Jedi, but Sang saw through her attempt at subterfuge and instead used her as bait to draw Jennir into a trap. Ember was tied to a pole and gagged; if she tried to warn Jennir, she would be shot by his droid [[Izee]]. However, Jennir was more cunning than Sang had anticipated; he sent in H2 disguised as himself to make Sang reveal his location, then using telekinesis brought him out into the open. Sang ordered Izee to shoot Ember, but H2's chassis partially blocked the shot, leaving her wounded but not dead. Izee then attempted to shoot Jennir, but the Jedi deflected the shot with his lightsaber, causing it to rebound and destroy the droid. After Sang fled, Jennir attempted to heal Ember, but with uncertain results due to his emotional state and limited gifts in Force healing, and passed out.[[File:Dass Jennir Ember Chankeli first kiss.jpg|thumb|250px|Dass Jennir and Ember Chankeli first kiss]]Thankfully, the pair were rescued by the crew of the ''[[Uhumele]]'', who were searching for Jennir, and were given medical attention. When Jennir walked into the room, the two unexpectedly kissed, prompting the crew to give them some privacy. Jennir then broke off the kiss, reminding himself that as a Jedi he should be mindful of his emotion. However, Ember didn't mind. She then remembered that Maddie was left unaccounted for. Jennir went to talk with Captain [[Schurk-Heren]] to return to Prine. In the meantime, [[Meekerdin-maa]] provided Ember with new clothes that previously belonged to [[Crys Taanzer]], albeit not in her size. Sadly, Heren refused to return to Prine, as an Imperial battlecruiser was searching the planet. After the crew adjourned, Jennir told Ember that the mount he used during the rescue was helping guide Maddie back home, but he worries that he may have destroyed her hope of ever seeing them again. The pair then embrace as Jennir lamented how dangerous the galaxy is becoming."

Being a gracious host, Helen let the spacer in. She asked if they would watch the prisoners for her while she took a break. The spacer agreed. During this time, the pirates pleaded with the spacer to let them out, but they refused and informed Helen of their intent to escape.

A short time later, [[Ferus Olin]], [[Roan Lands]], [[Amie Antin]], and the boy [[Trever Flume]] broke into an Imperial facility to find out more about this secret project that Tarkin had been in charge of. However, they were discovered, and Roan was killed by Darth Vader, and Ferus and Amie captured, leaving Trever the only one to escape and hide from the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]]. That was when Linna discovered Flume and helped him escape with a plan that was supposed to be hers.

She asked Ferus to take her too, which he did.

He broke into the apartment to save her because she had enabled him to escape in Ussa and because Ferus asked him to look around there so that he could really free her this time. In the apartment Trever met Ry-Gaul, who also wanted to free her, thanking her and her husband Tobin for saving his life. Meanwhile, Tobin had escaped the Empire and contacted Master Ry-Gaul. That Zan Arbor would most likely be the first to test her memory-erasing drug on Linna, led Trever and Ry-Gaul to rescue her that same day. They lurked on the landing pad until Zan Arbor arrived with her. Then they lurked them in the turbolift and while Ry-Gaul fended off the blaster shots of Zan Arbor, Linna managed to give her the reminder drug so that she forgot all about her experiments. In the apartment she took all the notes for security. Later, after a long time, she met her husband Tobin again.

Towards the end of the war, Admiral Dodonna was contacted by another naval officer, [[Carth Onasi]], informing her of the location of a massive orbital factory called the [[Star Forge]], an ancient relic of the [[Infinite Empire]]. The Star Forge was being used to churn out all the starships and war droids that powered the Sith fleet. Dodonna realized that this was the opportunity she desperately needed to put an end to the war. Gathering a fleet together, Admiral Dodonna set out for the [[Lehon system|Star Forge system]]. En route, Admiral Dodonna's fleet was reunited with many survivors of the Sith attack on the [[Jedi Enclave]] on [[Dantooine/Legends|Dantooine]].

Dodonna was contacted by Carth Onasi once more, from the ''Ebon Hawk'', whose crew deactivated a massive interdictor field being generated from the nearby planet [[Lehon]], which would have otherwise destroyed the fleet. Admiral Dodonna was suffering heavy losses in space and suggested a retreat, but Carth insisted that the Republic probably wouldn't get another chance to strike at the Star Forge again.

Her entire fleet was faced with an impenetrable defensive line, preventing her from ordering a bombardment of the Star Forge. Carth attributed this to [[Bastila Shan]], a fallen [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] who was very adept at using [[battle meditation]], a [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Force power/Legends|ability]] that allowed her to inspire allied troops and demoralize enemies, influencing an entire battle. Bastila's battle meditation was allowing the Sith to quickly counter every strategy Admiral Dodonna devised.

Soon Dodonna's relentless press against the Sith ranks finally punctured a breach in the fleet's formation, splitting it into two groups.

With these out of commission, the Star Forge would fall out of orbit and crash into the star below. This strategy was quickly implemented. After Admiral Dodonna's capital ships destroyed the stabilizers, she ordered the fleet to pull back away from the Star Forge, unwilling to risk any of her ships being destroyed during the Star Forge's descent.The Star Forge was finished, colliding with a solar flare which caused the Star Forge to incinerate from within.

Dodonna herself awarded the crew of the ''Ebon Hawk'' with the [[Cross of Glory]], the Republic's most prestigious medal, on the steps of the [[Temple of the Ancients]] (the very place that the crew had disabled the disruptor field generator at), thus commemorating them for their invaluable support during the [[Battle of Rakata Prime|battle]]; even the crew's droids were given medals.&lt;ref name=""KOTOR"" /&gt;The remainder of the war was short; the [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] and [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lords]] on the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]] homeworld of [[Korriban]] quickly tore each other apart as each attempted to seize the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, a title held by Malak until his death, in a quick yet brutal civil war. This was the final blow to the Sith war effort, and the Jedi Civil War was over, though the Republic still had to recover from the destruction caused by the war.

At some point, she mated with [[Risstenni's mate|another Wookiee]] and [[Reproduction/Legends|gave birth]] to a son, [[Chywarra]].&lt;ref name=""From the Trees"" /&gt; Circa [[21 BBY/Legends|21 BBY]],&lt;ref name=""Date"" /&gt; the family became residents of [[Kiirloor]], a Wookiee settlement that had been established on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Cularin/Legends|Cularin]] following the [[Death/Legends|death]] of the Wookiee [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kirlocca]]. However, the [[Wyrd]], a group of [[Tarasin]] [[The Force/Legends|Force]] [[Witch/Legends|witches]] that lived on Cularin, opposed the presence of the Wookiees at Kiirloor. One morning, two [[Standard month/Legends|months]] after the establishment of Kiirloor, the Wyrd kidnapped Chywarra and planned to draw power from him using a hand-shaped [[Force artifact|Force-imbued statue]] known as the [[Hand artifact]]. The Wyrd hoped this would allow them to cause the inactive [[Volcano/Legends|volcano]] [[Cloud Mountain]] to erupt and destroy Kiirloor.&lt;ref name=""From the Trees"" /&gt;After waking up to find Chywarra missing, Risstenni began looking for him. After a while she found a toy [[Ryyk blade/Legends|ryyk blade]] that belonged to her son, and she left it in a [[Tree/Legends|tree]] near Cloud [[Mountain/Legends|Mountain]] to act as a sign for anyone who tried to follow her and Chywarra. She continued searching and sighted Chywarra being carried up the side of Cloud Mountain by a member of the Wyrd, so she climbed up the volcano and began looking for her son in the tunnels inside the mountain. Eventually, she discovered a large cavern that served as the headquarters of a Wyrd enclave that was located inside the mountain, and she began observing the Tarasin inside the chamber. However, she overheard some Wyrd members talking about how Chywarra had survived a session inside the Hand artifact; angered, Risstenni rushed out to attack the Tarasin. The group's leader, [[Xinishia]], told her that they would kill Chywarra if she tried to fight them, and she then used the Force to [[Mind trick/Legends|compel]] Risstenni to sit down. Xinishia offered to let Risstenni take Chywarra's place inside the statue during the Wyrd's next ritual. Risstenni agreed, as she could not see any other way to save the life of her son.&lt;ref name=""From the Trees"" /&gt;The Tarasin allowed Risstenni to say goodbye to Chywarra and then helped her into the artifact's thumb. The Wookiee scratched at the interior of the device, but she was unable to climb out because it was made of a highly polished smooth material. When the Tarasin began their ritual, Risstenni was overcome with a feeling that something inside her was trying to tear her body apart, which caused her to pass out. The device drained her life force and killed her, transforming her into a [[Force ghost|dark side spirit]]. When Risstenni came to, she discovered that she had changed form and could move through the side of the statue. She thought about going to get help, but she did not want to leave her son, so she decided to remain within the enclave. The Wyrd ignored her in her new form and allowed her to listen to them discussing their plan; thus she learned of the witches' plan to destroy Kiirloor.&lt;ref name=""From the Trees"" /&gt;{{RPG|''[[From the Trees]]''}}When the Wookiees of Kiirloor discovered that Risstenni and Chywarra were missing, they sent representatives to ask [[Mother (title)/Legends|Mother]] [[Dariana]] of the Tarasin [[Hiironi irstat]] if she knew who was responsible for the pair's disappearance. Dariana sent the [[Heroes of Cularin]], a group of freelance agents who operated in the [[Cularin system]], to investigate the matter, and they traveled to the tunnels inside Cloud Mountain. Risstenni approached them while in the guise of a ghostly [[Humanoid/Legends|humanoid]], then worked out how to manifest herself and appeared to them in the form of a Wookiee. She spoke to the agents and explained to them how she had died. She then begged them to rescue her son and warned the agents that it was dangerous for them to continue traveling through the tunnels. However, while she was talking to them, a Tarasin [[Unidentified Tarasin Force ghost|Force ghost]] attacked the agents, with the aim of preventing them from interfering in the Wyrd's plans. Risstenni responded by entering combat with the spirit and allowed the agents to confront Xinishia and the other members of the Wyrd.&lt;ref name=""From the Trees"" /&gt;{{Endgame}}"

Her husband at some point died in service to the guardians. Droo would then marry the [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Rawk|Nat Skywalker]].When Skywalker later left the Jedi Order he adopted Droo's daughter Ahnah as his own, and the pair adopted two children, Skeeto and Micah, together. The children were never made aware of their father's former life as a Jedi, and Nat began to live under the alias of ""Bantha"" Rawk.In [[137 ABY]], Droo's family [[Skirmish on Iego|fought together]] against [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]] pirates when [[Cade Skywalker]], Droo's nephew through Nat, and the crew of the ''Mynock'' came to their aid. The crews intervention ultimately saved the families lives. Shortly after this, Nat temporarily left his family to escort Cade and his crew to the [[Hidden Temple]] so he could confer with the [[Jedi High Council (New Jedi Order)|Jedi High Council]] in the hopes of being granted aid against the forces of [[Darth Krayt]].After Cade's proposal to assassinate Krayt was rejected by the Council, and he chose to continue with the plan regardless, Nat reunited with his family on [[Kiffu/Legends|Kiffu]]. During this time, Droo's daughter Ahnah followed in her mothers footsteps by training to become a Kiffu Guardian. Against all odds, Cade's plan ended with the death of Krayt, before he rushed the severely injured [[Azlyn Rae]] to Kiffex, in the hopes that Droo's healing powers could save her life.Cade and his crew eventually reached Kiffex, and Cade handed Azlyn over to Droo. Droo said she could only save Azlyn if she wanted to be saved, and Cade said she did. While Droo and Nat tried their best, Azlyn rejected their attempts to heal her.

Droo didn't like the idea, thinking it would make Azlyn the next [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]], but she stood behind Nat.The suit allowed Azlyn to live, but she wasn't happy about it.

She told him she understood, and that [[Zharia Vos]] had contacted her and requested that she reactivate her [[General/Legends|general's]] commission within the Kiffu Guardians as a precaution against possible actions by Krayt's forces for not allowing an Imperial base to be build on either of the Kiffar homeworlds. When her husband asked about Annah, Droo told him she was off with her unit. Bantha lamented, stating that their daughter was too young for War. Droo, however, stated that she was always fated to become a Guardian, and there was no running from her destiny, just like Bantha. As the pair signed offline, the two said goodbye for the last time.Nat Skywalker was still in the Hidden Temple when the Sith [[Attack on the Hidden Temple|attacked]] there.

Haydnat Treen,NaN,Female,Human,"During the [[Unification Summit]], she orchestrated a [[Kidnap attempt in the Galactic Empire Embassy Complex|kidnap attempt]] to remove [[Jagged Fel]] as [[Head of State/Legends|head]] of the [[Imperial Remnant]]. The attempt failed as Fel managed to set off the alarm within the embassy and defeated Treen's [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]].

After removing any thoughts of suspicion on the other Moffs, he tracked several transactions through a [[Borleias/Legends|Borleias]] bank which led him back to Senator Treen. He met Treen and asked her why she had tried to have Fel kidnapped. She revealed that the attempt was only one part of a larger plot to unify the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] and the Imperial Remnant into a new Galactic Empire with Lecersen as [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]].&lt;ref name=""Backlash"" /&gt;At the [[Kuat Embassy]], Treen revealed her plans to Lecersen. She wanted to have Lecersen replace Fel, even temporarily, as Head of State in time so as to preside over the Imperial reunification with the Galactic Alliance, giving him all the credit and making him the second most powerful being in the galaxy, next to the [[Chief of State (Galactic Alliance)|Chief of State]] of the Galactic Alliance. The next step was to oust Galactic Alliance Chief of State [[Natasi Daala]]. For this she planned to use the [[Emergency Powers Act (Galactic Alliance)|Emergency Powers Act]] that the Senate had set up after the [[Second Galactic Civil War]]. The act declared that the Chief of State could not suspend the Senate and that the [[Appropriations and Disbursements Committee]] could freeze the government budget, therefore blocking the Chief of State's powers. Treen planned to manipulate the political crisis that followed, which she planned to use to force Daala to invoke the act. Treen believed that the public backlash would force her to resign and be replaced by the Imperial leader, whom by then would be Lecersen.&lt;ref name=""Backlash"" /&gt;Senator [[Fost Bramsin]] of [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] and the Chiefs of the Alliance [[Galactic Alliance Defense Force|Armed Forces]] already supported Treen's [[Lecersen Conspiracy|conspiracy]].

As Lecersen had planned, the attack failed, and the Solos believed that Daala planned the attack.The conspirators continued to plot an overthrow of Daala and were about to execute it when the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] enacted their own coup which was more powerful. By then, Treen knew that their plans would be in complete ruin if they did not adapt. She made a deal with the Jedi, which made the Triumvirate, led by [[Saba Sebatyne]] representing the Jedi, [[General/Legends|General]] Jaxton representing the Galactic Alliance Defense Force, and herself, representing the [[Senate]]. With this adaptation, the plans continued to eventually restore the Empire in her dream.Although Jaxton was later replaced by [[Wynn Dorvan]] as a member of the triumvirate, the conspiracy's plans continued unhindered, and they even brought in a new member in the form of fledgling Senator Kameron Suldar, secretly the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] [[Ivaar Workan]]. However, when Daala, who had escaped prison thanks to [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]], figured out about Lecersen's involvement with the [[Freedom Flight]] and his membership in the conspiracy, she blackmailed him into joining her quest to take over the Imperial Remnant. Later, when Treen realized that something was wrong when Lecersen went missing, she quickly informed another conspiracy member, General [[Stavin Thaal]], that they need to disband what they were doing. So Treen decided to kill a fellow conspiracy member, [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] Senator [[Fost Bramsin]], while making it look like he died of old age before she retired back to Kuat. The rest of the conspiracy fell apart as Thaal later forced Jaxton to commit suicide and Parova was killed by members of the [[Lost Tribe of Sith]] in order to frame ex-Jedi fugitive [[Tahiri Veila]].Following the Galactic Alliance and Jedi Order's defeat of [[Abeloth]] and the Sith, Treen's involvement with the conspiracy became publicly known."

At the time of Crian's role as a teacher, the Jedi were at war with the [[Sith/Legends|Sith]], and Crian had taken on the mission of locating and dealing with the Dark Sider known as the Marauder, the Madman, and the Dark Killer, [[Kaox Krul]]. Traveling across the galaxy in her ship, the ''Golden Song'', Crian and her apprentice had tracked Kaox Krul to the planet [[Harpori]] in the [[Balowa system]]. Following the Madman`s trail of massacres and darkness, Crian and her apprentice finally pinpointed Kaox`s location.However, the Marauder got the jump on the two Jedi and in a daring space battle, Kaox engaged the duo. Although they survived his attack, their ship was greatly damaged. As Kaox attempted to finish them off, the two Jedi crippled the dark sider's own ship sending it to the planet's surface below. Damaged beyond capability of flight, the Jedi brought the ship to a safe landing only made possible by [[The Force/Legends|the Force]], both the Jedi and Madman were able to survive their crash. However, the Jedi were not safe; for Kaox was unwavering in his goal to destroy them. The Jedi managed to salvage a speeder bike from the wreckage of the ''Golden Song'' and began to flee the area; hoping to avoid Krul until they could regroup.Before they were able to flee however, Kaox Krul engaged Dree in battle as Crian readied the speeder bike for take-off. She managed to start it, snatching Dree upon the bike as she drove off into the forest.Empowered with dark side energies, Kaox was able to pursue the fleeing Jedi at amazing speed; catching them and destroying their bike with his blade. The lightsaber strike to the speeder caused Kaox to lose his balance, allowing Crian and Dree an escape on foot. For two days Crian was able to keep her and her apprentice ahead of Krul, but eventually he drew closer.Kaox approached the Jedi Knight at a lake in the forest where she had stopped to rest. Realizing that she could no longer run from the Madman, Crian engaged him in a fierce battle. It took all of Crian's strength in the Force to keep up with Kaox and the two traded blow after blow until Dree jumped into the battle herself, forcing Kaox to fight an adversary on each side. Using the Force to send Crian flying into the lake, Kaox vaulted over Crian's apprentice, landing behind her to deliver a killing blow. Mortified at the loss of her apprentice, Crian gave into the anger that was deep within her. Crian and Krul eventually took their battle over the surface of the lake, using the dark energies to hover above the water. With so much energy pouring into keeping themselves in the air, the two impaled each other simultaneously. Crian's body disappeared, becoming [[Force ghost|one with the Force]] as well as Krul's body."

Hestizo had a connection to this orchid and thus could not venture too far away from it, otherwise the [[Plant/Legends|plant]] would wilt. She managed to escape with the orchid after Scabrous used a chemical from it to engineer an immortality formula. The drawback of the formula was that it ravaged the body until there was nothing left but a cannibalistic monstrosity, which quickly spread throughout the academy. Allying herself with Tulkh, Hestizo convinced the orchid to grow the pieces of itself within the zombies to stop them, only to exhaust the orchid. However, Scabrous used the [[Neti]] librarian, [[Dail'Liss]], to lure Hestizo to the library by mimicking the voice of the orchid which was still alive amidst the infection known as the Sickness. Hestizo was alone after she and Tulkh had parted ways, so she made for the library in search of her only remaining ally. Caught in his trap, Scabrous strapped Hestizo down on a sacrificial altar, ready to cut out her heart with a traditional Sith sword and become forever immortal.Hestizo was able to free herself from Scabrous's sacrifice, but before Scabrous could outright kill her, Hestizo's brother, [[Rojo Trace|Rojo]], arrived and briefly dueled the Sith Lord. Scabrous prevailed and killed Rojo, but Hestizo was able to kill him by telepathically convincing the orchid to sprout itself outward from his head, severely weakening him. She was then able to finish off Scabrous, now a complete zombie, using his own Sith sword against him. Hestizo managed to escape infection from the remaining Sith zombies when Tulkh's ship, the ''Mirocaw'', piloted by Sith Academy mechanic [[Pergus Frode]], flew in to save her. After evading the academy's perimeter defenses, Scabrous' HK droid managed to manipulate the turbolasers into destroying the control tower instead of the ''Mirocaw'', taking with it all the zombies.Even then, Hestizo found that the Sickness still had a chance of infecting the rest of the galaxy. Tulkh had become infected and chained himself up against a detachable wall in his ship when he felt the Sickness begin to take over. Tulkh asked Hestizo to open up the wall he chained himself to so that he would be blown out into the vacuum of space. Before she could do so, [[Rance Lussk]], an infected apprentice from the academy who had stowed away on the ''Mirocaw'', revealed himself. He attacked, but Hestizo was able to avoid his lunge, throwing him toward Tulkh and releasing the bulkhead, ejecting Tulkh and Lussk into space. With the final infected dead, Hestizo rested assured that the Sickness was over.Hestizo returned to Marfa where a new black orchid was waiting for her care.

At the time, a talented [[Hero of Tython|Padawan]], whom Orgus Din chose to take on as his Padawan, had defeated a [[Dark Jedi/Legends|Dark Jedi]] apprentice named [[Callef]], who was found carrying a Jedi lightsaber. Further investigation discovered that the Flesh Raiders were taught to use the Force, which Kiwiiks assumed they learned from a [[Holocron/Legends|holocron]] the Padawan had found. However, Din realized that the perpetrators behind the attacks was his former Padawan, [[Bengel Morr]], presumed dead in the [[Sacking of Coruscant]]. While Din and his Padawan remained on Tython to stop Morr, Kiwiiks and Carsen journeyed to Coruscant to investigate a dark presence on the Republic capital.Din and his Padawan, now a full-fledged Jedi Knight, went to Coruscant too and met with Kiwiiks and Carsen during a meeting with [[General/Legends|General]] [[Var Suthra]] and Doctor [[Tarnis (Sith Lord)|Eli Tarnis]], regarding the controversial [[Planet Prison]] a superweapon that could ionized a planet's atmosphere, disabling any ships that tried to leave and safely blockading the planet without loss of life. Kiwiiks expressed concern regarding the design files that had been stolen, but Tarnis was seemingly unconcerned about the security risks. Tarnis brushed off her protest, stating that the files were too encrypted for anyone to understand, but Var Suthra informed the Jedi that his agents were searching tirelessly for the files.While Din, Kiwiiks, and Suthra met with [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Dorian Janarus]] aboard the Chancellor's cruiser ''Founder'', Din ordered his former apprentice to aid the Republic agents in recovering the files. Kiwiiks also left her Padawan with the Knight and Tarnis, suggesting that Carsen's security expertise might be useful.Later, when the Knight recovered the stolen files, an SIS agent decrypted them and discovered that they contain information on all of the Republic superweapon projects. Kiwiiks immediately departed for [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] to secure the [[Shock Drum]]. But shortly after her arrival at the Shock drum facility, she was attacked and defeated by [[Darth Angral]]'s apprentice, Lord [[Praven]]. He took her captive and acquired the Shock Drum, but left the facility staff unharmed.&lt;ref name=""The Shock Drum""&gt;{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|The Shock Drum|Tatooine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiwiiks and the superweapon were taken to a cave in the [[Dune Sea/Legends|Dune Sea]], where Angral ordered the weapon activated and for Kiwiiks to be left near it.&lt;ref name=""Desert Duel""&gt;{{TORcite|type=class|Jedi Knight|Desert Duel|Tatooine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiwiiks put herself into a deep trance to protect herself from the intense vibrations emanating from the weapon. Thankfully, the Knight and Carsen, now the Knight's Padawan, arrived in time to save her, deactivating the Shock Drum with Praven's transmitter. As the Knight ordered the Shock Drum destroyed, Carsen came clean to Kiwiiks about her past as a [[Children of the Emperor|Child of the Emperor]]. Kiwiiks told her former student that her past doesn't matter, but what's important is that she is proud of her.&lt;ref name=""The Sand Demon"" /&gt;Kiwiiks was then returned to Tython to recover from her ordeal. She would've nearly had a shortly recovery when Angral combined all the superweapon projects into the [[Desolator (superweapon)|Desolator]] in an attempt to destroy the Jedi Order. Thankfully, the Knight and Carsen defeated Angral and saved Tython. When the two came before the Jedi Council, Kiwiiks lamented the untimely death of Din, who was killed by Angral before his confrontation with the Knight. Master Shan added that while they lost one of their greatest masters, in his place stands the Knight, a Jedi without equal. She then turned to Carsen, glad that she managed to reject the [[Vitiate|Sith Emperor]] during their confrontation with Angral. On the Knight and Kiwiiks' recommendation, the Council granted Carsen the rank of Jedi Knight.However, Var Suthra informed the Council that they are receiving reports of hostilities across the galaxy. Kiwiiks remarked that even in death, Angral had finally inspired the Sith to violence. Shan added that the Knight, whom she christens as the Hero of Tython, to be their most valuable against the rising darkness and the Force had shown her that the weight of the galaxy rest on their shoulders.About a year later, the Hero and Carsen joined a strike team formed by [[Tol Braga]] in a daring plan to capture the Emperor, bring him to Tython and redeem him to the light side. But before they departed, Masters Shan, Kiwiiks and Kaedan requested a moment of their time. Braga's former team member [[Jomar Chul]] had received a [[Force vision/Legends|Force vision]] revealing that if the Hero joins the mission, it will fail and the Jedi Knight will fall to the dark side and join the Sith. Braga dismissed his concerns, stating that the future is always in motion and that the Council doesn't place judgment solely on visions. Nonetheless, the Hero chose to defer to the decision of the Council. Kiwiiks expressed confidence in the Hero's loyalty, and Shan agreed with her. As Chul stormed out of the Council chamber, frustrated that they won't heed his warning, Kaedan pleaded Braga to reconsider but the [[Kel Dor/Legends|Kel Dor]] was certain his plan would work.When Braga's team never returned from their mission, the Council feared that they had failed. After many months, the Hero and their companions returned, accompanied by Lord [[Scourge (Sith)|Scourge]], the [[Emperor's Wrath]], who had suddenly switched sides. Scourge explained to the Council that centuries ago, he had a vision that the Emperor will destroy the galaxy but the Hero will be the one to stop him. [[Galactic War|Renewed war]] is only a diversion to conceal the Emperor's true plan, threatening the death of all living things. He explained that a thousand years ago, the Emperor used a life-sapping ritual on his home planet of [[Nathema]], consuming all life on the planet and used those life essences to become immortal. Now he plans on recreating the ritual on a galactic scale to become virtually unstoppable. But the ritual requires billions of simultaneous deaths, which he plans on initiating on [[Belsavis/Legends|Belsavis]]. Kiwiiks worried that the Emperor had finally discovered the location of the Republic prison planet, which the Jedi have hidden for decades. Scourge stated that once the sacrifice occurs, the ritual cannot be stopped and insisted they save Belsavis. Kaedan didn't trust the Sith, to the point where he holds his lightsaber to his throat. However, the Hero vouched for Scourge's relative trustworthiness and the Sith insisted that he's better off working against the Emperor than imprisoned. Shan consented to an alliance but warned the Hero not to become too reliant on Scourge.Kiwiiks was later stationed on [[Corellia/Legends|Corellia]] during a [[Battle of Corellia|significant battle]], where she was cornered by two Sith assassins. The Sith showed her a holo of Master Braga, corrupted to the dark side by the Emperor, who ordered them to kill her. Thankfully, the Hero of Tython arrived to her rescue once again. When the Hero explained to Kiwiiks their intent to rally the Jedi to stop Braga from committing mass genocide, the Togruta admitted that she never fully recovered from her ordeal on Tatooine. Instead, she felt that she should help evacuate the wounded, an idea the Hero agreed with."

Darth Nyriss,NaN,Female,Sith,"A female Sith Pureblood, Nyriss was an exceptionally powerful and ambitious woman. Darth Nyriss was one of the most talented and influential figures of the [[Sith Empire/Legends|Sith Empire]] in her time. Perhaps her most notable accomplishments were the conquest of [[Drezzi]], the destruction of [[Melldia]], and gaining membership of the Empire's [[Dark Council]] on the basis of her talents. However, the Dark Council in her time was rife with internal power struggles and plotting. Nyriss, in particular, was subjected to several assassination attempts. Due to these occurrences, the [[Vitiate|Sith Emperor]] advised Nyriss to temporarily seclude herself from the Council's politics until the matter was resolved; she resided in a well-protected citadel on the western edge of [[Kaas City]] during this time. The Sith Emperor also suggested Nyriss to hire an agent who would be detached from the Council's politics and help her investigate the matter. However, Nyriss had plans of her own, which she put in to motion once a renowned warrior called Lord [[Scourge (Sith)|Scourge]] arrived in Dromund Kass to assist her.&lt;ref name=""Revan""&gt;''[[The Old Republic: Revan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;By the time Nyriss met Scourge, her physical appearance had degenerated immensely as a result of the powerful dark side rituals that she chose to delve in; she was highly proficient in the arts of [[Sith magic|Sith sorcery]] and strong in the dark side of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]].

By this time, Scourge was not just ready to remove Nyriss from the picture but was also willing to help Revan in his plan to assassinate the Sith Emperor. As part of this plan, Scourge revealed Nyriss's treachery to the Sith Emperor, who then decided to eliminate all possible threats to him on urgent basis.

Korr landed on the moon, stalked by [[One Sith]] [[Agent/Legends|agent]] [[Kell Douro]]. Korr discovered the clones and [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|dueled]] with Alpha, eventually killing him. Douro was later killed by Korr's companion, the [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] [[Khedryn Faal]], and the Community used Douro's [[CloakShape fighter/Legends|CloakShape fighter]] [[Predator (Kell Douro's ship)|''Predator'']] to escape the moon.&lt;ref name=""Cross""&gt;''[[Crosscurrent]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the moon's [[Atmosphere/Legends|atmosphere]], the [[Starfighter/Legends|fighter]] passed through a cloud of [[Lignan]] [[Ore/Legends|ore]] caused by the destruction of the ''Harbinger''. The ore granted the [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] members of the Community greater power in the use of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], but it also accelerated the effects of the sickness. When the Community fell into agony from the sickness's symptoms, [[Soldier (clone)|Soldier]], a clone of [[Jaden Korr]] and the only member of the Communitywho did not suffer from the sickness, injected Grace and the others with Metacycline. He then suggested the Community head to the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Fhost]], where he hoped they could acquire more of the ingredients necessary for Metacycline. Along the way, Blessing died from the sickness, as did [[Gift]], another [[Youngling/Legends|child]] of the Community's clones. Grace and her mother both survived the journey, but were unconscious. After Soldier injected Grace with a shot of [[adrenaline]], he, Seer, and the clone [[Runner (clone)|Runner]] headed to Fhost's [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[City/Legends|city]], [[Farpoint]], in a [[Landspeeder/Legends|landspeeder]], taking the unconscious Grace and Hunter with them. The Community went to the [[Farpoint Medical Center]], and, after a [[Skirmish at the Farpoint Medical Center|confrontation]] with Jaden Korr, hijacked a [[Supply ship/Legends|supply ship]] and took Korr's companion Faal hostage after knocking him unconscious.&lt;ref name=""Riptide"" /&gt;Grace reacted well to the medication Soldier gave her, and she regained consciousness aboard the supply ship. Faal later awoke inside the ship's [[Cockpit/Legends|cockpit]], where he met Grace. As she smiled at him, he stuck his tongue out at her, causing her to giggle. He was then interrogated by the clones, and, after gleaning what information Faal knew, the clones agreed to kill the spacer. Runner took him to the ship's airlock to eject him into [[Realspace/Legends|space]], but the clone was killed by the [[Umbaran/Legends|Umbaran]] [[Nyss Nenn]], who had sneaked aboard the ship. Nenn allowed Faal to live with the intention of trading him for Korr, and used a pair of [[flexcuff]]s to restrain the spacer to a crossbar in the ship's corridors. Grace, who had sneaked away from the cockpit, later found Faal and helped free him by giving him a [[Knife/Legends|knife]]. She then fled as her Metacycline began to wear off and the symptoms of the sickness worsened, causing her skin to bulge and roil as it distorted her facial features.

Nenn tried to throw a [[Vibroblade/Legends|vibroblade]] at her, but she ran away before he could. As Soldier fought with the Umbaran, Grace ran to a [[Turbolift/Legends|turbolift]] and took it down to the floor where she had found Faal.

At one point in her career, her skills earned her praise from [[Finis Valorum/Legends|Chancellor Valorum]]. Eventually, her success as a bounty hunter caught the attention of [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] who wanted her to compete with other bounty hunters in the [[Box/Legends|Box]], a death machine designed by [[Moralo Eval/Legends|Moralo Eval]], on [[Serenno/Legends|Serenno]] to win the honor of kidnapping [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. She witnessed [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]] murder another bounty hunter [[Bulduga/Legends|Bulduga]] to get his hat. Soon, Dooku briefed everyone on the [[Tournament on Serenno/Legends|challenge]] the bounty hunters had to face including telling them about The Box. They were all deprived of their weapons and soon they entered The Box.Their first challenge was to escape a room that was filling with [[Dioxis/Legends|dioxis]] gas. Platforms began to rise from the ground and all the bounty hunters, including Twazzi, climbed up but was almost crushed by the lowering ceiling so she was forced to hang between two platforms. Another bounty hunter, [[Rako Hardeen/Legends|Rako Hardeen]] who was actually [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in disguise, found a secret tunnel underneath the ground. All the hunters followed him out of the room into the second challenge, thus surviving the first one.In the second round, ledges began to slide out of the walls with a sword resembling a [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] swinging around on its front. Bulduga's brother [[Onca/Legends|Onca]] quickly fell prey to the blades. As before, Hardeen saw an open tunnel on the ceiling. Using the ledges, he and Bane hopped to the top towards the tunnel with the other bounty hunters following behind. Bounty hunters [[Kiera Swan/Legends|Kiera Swan]] and [[Sinrich/Legends|Sinrich]] were killed as well but Twazzi got out of the challenge along with the remaining bounty hunters.The third challenge involved the whole room being [[Ray shield/Legends|ray shielded]] and the walls closing in. The switch to deactivate the shields was located in shaft in the wall behind a smaller ray-shield. Eval provided a special serum that, if injected can provide the person temporary immunity to the ray-shields.Platforms began to rise out of the center of the ground. [[Jakoli/Legends|Jakoli]] was instantly electrocuted as well when the floor he stood became ray-shielded. A hunter, [[Derrown/Legends|Derrown]] was able to inject the serum due to his anatomy of being immune to such serums. During his attempt to get to the button, [[Mantu/Legends|Mantu]] lost his balance and fell to his death. Derrown was eventually able to press the button and the surviving hunters made it to the next and final round.[[File:TwazziTurnedIntoPalpatine-CoN.png|thumb|left|260px|Twazzi in disguise of Chancellor Palpatine]]They found themselves on a platform with the ground below them doused in flames. This challenge involved sharpshooting. A small yellow target zipped across the wall. Next to the them, a sniper rifle appeared in a small machine. [[Sixtat/Legends|Sixtat]] took the rifle and aimed at the target. He shot the first two perfectly but missed the third. As a result, the platform he stood on disappeared into the ground and Sixtat fell into the flames which killed him. Hardeen took another rifle that replaced the empty spot on the machine. He shot all three targets easily but Eval gave him five more targets to shoot. Hardeen shot the first four but that was all the ammo the sniper rifle had. Eval scoffed at Hardeen and by pressing some buttons on his wrist, caused the platform beneath Hardeen to drop. However, Bane saved him, taunting Eval to kill Hardeen like a man to which Dooku agreed. Eval soon dropped to the floor and Twazzi and the other hunters witnessed the two brawl, in which Hardeen won. Dooku then congratulated the survivors and announced Bane to be the leader of the group to kidnap Palpatine.During the [[Festival of Light/Legends|Festival of Light]], the bounty hunters [[Skirmish in Theed/Legends|launched their kidnapping plot]]. Twazzi and [[Embo/Legends|Embo]] were the ones to be disguised as [[Senate Guard/Legends|Senate Guards]], in order to escort Palpatine. Bane handed out a special mapping device to lead them to the meeting point, and a [[Multispectrum disguise suite|holographic disguise matrix]], which gave Embo and Twazzi the appearance of [[Senate Commando/Legends|Senate Commandos]]. After Derrown deactivated the [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]] which protected the Chancellor on the festival, the explosion rendered Palpatine unconscious. At that time, the real Palpatine was concealed under the image of a Senate Commando with the help of the disguise matrix, while Twazzi turned into Palpatine. However, [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin]] and [[Mace Windu/Legends|Windu]] managed to stop them from fleeing, and Twazzi and Embo were transformed back. Then Twazzi started throwing punches at Anakin. On the third punch, Anakin used his lightsaber to cut off her right arm. She and Embo were then both arrested, while Bane and Eval escaped with the 'real' Palpatine."

After her father was presumed to be killed in [[5 BBY/Legends|5 BBY]], Elli and her stepmother, [[Dah'lis Stark|Dah'lis]], had a small portion of the inheritance while Iaclyn took the majority.

Cross noticed she was being harassed by a man named [[Verpel]] so he introduced himself as her fiancé which caused the man to leave. Elli was appreciative for Cross's assistance and talked to him about her family and situation. When she saw her brother coming over, she excused herself and went back to her quarters at the [[Stark Compound]]. Cross later returned to the Compound with Dah'lis and was present when she was murdered. As he was being escorted away by Espos, he came across Elli in the hallway. He attempted to talk to Stark but was assaulted by the Espos. When he retaliated and disabled his escort, Stark suggested he head to the garage to get away. Cross stole a speeder and was forced to try to escape through the house.

She believed him and helped him find out information about the Iron Eclipse project. Unknown to them, Iaclyn's droid Majordomo was observing them and reported back to his master. Iaclyn ordered the droid to kill Cross but to not injure Elli. Cross was able to destroy the droid and arranged transport on the [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|''Millennium Falcon'']] to the Eclipse space station so he could further investigate. Once they boarded the freighter, Elli expressed her doubts whether the ship was even spaceworthy. Solo assured her it was ok. Once they left Etti IV, Cross and Stark retired to one of the ships cabins so she could attend to his wounds from his encounter with Majordomo. Cross revealed his history to Elli, explaining his devotion to the Empire. They then shared a kiss. Upon reaching the space station, Stark attempted to authorize their landing but was denied, causing the Falcon to be attacked by Vulture droid starfighters. Cross managed to find a landing bay and he and Stark departed the Falcon allowing it to escape and draw off the droid starfighters. She and Cross confronted Iaclyn but were subdued by droids under control of the Iron Eclipse virus. Iaclyn explained to Elli that she put herself in danger by coming to the space station. He revealed that she was not the daughter of Iaco Stark, but rather the result of an affair Arris Rossum had. Therefore, Iaco Stark felt no connection for her and would not hesitate to kill her. Iaclyn explained that his attempts to arrange a marriage were to get Elli safely away from the Starks. Elli witnessed the murder of her brother when Iaco appeared behind Iaclyn and stabbed him through the chest. Iaco greeted her and told her he owed her nothing and was going to kill her. Elli managed to grab a blaster and retreated with Cross to the exit of the room where they were confronted by a reprogrammed IN-GA.&lt;ref name=""AotE4""&gt;''[[Agent of the Empire—Iron Eclipse, Part 4]]''&lt;/ref&gt;Elli was restrained by droids while Iaco watched Cross and IN-GA battle.

She fled to the landing pad on Cross's orders and attempted to contact the ''Millennium Falcon'' for retrieval. After Cross disabled Iaco, he and Elli leapt from the sinking space station onto the top of the Falcon where they entered through the dorsal hatch. Elli made her way to the cockpit and asked to jump to hyperspace, but Solo informed here they had to clear the planet's gravity well first. When IN-GA contacted the Falcon and explained she was trapped on the dying space station, Elli asked if they could go back and retrieve her. Solo stated that they couldn't for safety reasons, but there might be a chance to rescue the droid by using the ship's tractor beams. When Cross rejected that plan, stating it was too dangerous, Elli tried to sentimentally persuade Cross. He responded that Inga was ""simply a droid. A machine.""Once free of Reltooine, Elli and Cross retired to one of the cabins in the Falcon. She reaffirmed Cross's promise to get her out of the Corporate Sector and suggested that she might like to go to Coruscant and become a spy like Cross.

She ignored most of the normal stylistic conventions of blastsword dueling, favoring the styles from the blastsword's prominence in [[Standard year/Legends|years]] past.

By the time of the New Republics' rediscovery of Adumar, Cheriss had become the planets' Ground Champion thanks to her blastsword skills. The [[Perator]] [[Pekaelic ke Teldan]] appointed Cheriss the official guide for the New Republics' pilot-ambassador group- which included [[Wedge Antilles/Legends]].{{Quote|""I want to be a pilot.

While undergoing treatment, Cheriss mentioned her vertigo condition to the doctors- who discovered a chemical imbalance in her bloodstream that could be treated with medication. Cured at last, Cheriss soon apologized to Wedge Antilles and joined his rogue Red Flight to resist the dictatorial onslaught of Perator Pakaelic against the ""lesser nations.""

Following the [[Treaty of Coruscant]] and during the ensuing [[Cold War (Galactic Republic&amp;ndash;Sith Empire)|Cold War]], Narezz was selected by Master Braga to join a [[Jedi strike team (capture of the Sith Emperor)|strike team]] intent on capturing the [[Vitiate|Sith Emperor]] and redeeming him. Unknown to Master Braga, the team's informant was actually Narezz's secret lover, [[Jomar Chul]].

Along with the help of a [[Hero of Tython]], his companions and the Republic troopers stationed at the planet led by Sergeant [[Fideltin Rusk]], they found the shuttle in a cave in [[Highmount Ridge]]. Leeha got there first, but was cornered by Imperial forces. When the Hero arrived to save her, they were contacted by [[Imperial Guard]]sman [[Lassicar]], who demanded they surrender, as a second wave of reinforcements appeared. However, Rusk and his men entered from above and rappeled down the walls, assisting the Jedi against the Imperials. They then found a cowardly Imperial engineer named [[Urrisov]], who, under gentle interrogation from the Hero, explained that the [[White Maw]] pirates had stolen the shuttle's databanks. However, they missed the decryption file, which Narezz took from the young tech. Sergeant Rusk had fought the pirates before the Empire arrived on Hoth, and knew that the White Maw kept a depot in a crashed dreadnaught protected by ray shields. The databanks would no doubt pass through the depot, but the ray shields needed to come down before the Jedi and soldiers could do anything to retrieve them.Narezz explained that the Meedees have discovered two generators powering the ray shields and instruct Rusk and the Hero to strike at them separately. Later meeting up at the Republic base just outside the [[Starship Graveyard (Hoth)|Starship Graveyard]], Narezz informed the Hero and Rusk that the Imperials and White Maw are fighting for control of the wreck of the ''[[Star of Coruscant]]''.

Force-users were practically unheard of on her homeworld, rendering Nadia as a freak in the eyes of her people.
